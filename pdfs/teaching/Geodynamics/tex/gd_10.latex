For convergent deformations, involving crustal thickening, the isostatic response is (generally) uplift (or mountainbuilding).  For extensional deformations the isostatic effect is in part subsidence (orbasin formation) and  in part uplift, depending on: \begin{itemize} \item  how theextensional strain is distributed within the lithosphere; and  \item whether mantle meltshave been added to the lithosphere during extension.  \end{itemize}  Basins formed as theisostatic consequence of extensional  deformations are termed stretch  basins  and includemost continental passive margins formed during continental breakup events.\section{Isostatic calculations}\subsubsection{Rift Phase Subsidence}   	The treatment of the isostatic consequences of anextensional deformation is  	similar to te treatment of the uplift caused by convergentdeformation, only now we have  also to consider the density distribution of the mediumfilling the basin. We first consider the  effects of a homogeneous extensional deformationon the scale of the lithosphere   with no magmatic additions (Figure \ref{stretch}):\begin{figure}[h,t,b] \label{stretch} \vspace{3.2in} \hspace{0.7in}\special{epsf=:gdfigs:chap10:Fig10_1.eps scale=0.650}\caption{\protect\scriptsize{Lithospheric-scale extensional geometry used to quantifysubsidence.}} \end{figure} \begin{equation}\left(\frac{\partial\dot\epsilon_{zz}}{\partial z}\right)_x = 0 \end{equation} Using thiscondition we can parameterize the deformation at any point within the basin in terms  ofthe one dimensional vertical strain: \begin{equation} \beta =\frac{1}{\dot{\epsilon}_{zz}}	 \end{equation} Which for plane strain ($\dot{\epsilon}_{yy}= 0$) gives  $\beta = \dot{\epsilon}_{xx}$  or, equivalently, the horizontal stretchacross the  basin. Note that $\beta$ is the reciprocal of  $f$, the thickening factor usedin Chapter 9. We can  formulate the isostatic effects of active rifting in the followingmanner. Assuming an intial linear  lithospheric geotherm, which amounts to ignoring theeffects of any internal heat production,  gives the temperature $T_z$ at depth $z$ (Figure\ref{stretchone}) :  \begin{eqnarray} 			T_z =  T_s + \left(T_l - T_s\right) \frac{z}{z_l}&	&			0  <  z  <  z_l \end{eqnarray} where $T_l$ is the temperature at the base of thelithosphere, $T_s$ is the temperature at the surface of  the lithsophere and $z_l$ is thethickness of the lithosphere prior to stretching (Figure \ref{stretchone}).  Letting $T_m$ equal the temperature difference across the lithosphere, and setting $T_s = 0$,  gives:\begin{eqnarray} 			T_z =  T_m \frac{ z}{z_l}		&	&		0  <  z  <  z_l \end{eqnarray} Afterhomogeneous stretching by a factor $\beta$ the thermal structure is given by:\begin{figure}[h,t,b] \label{stretchone} \vspace{3.6in} \hspace{0.6in}\special{epsf=:gdfigs:chap10:Fig10_2.eps scale=0.620}\caption{\protect\scriptsize{Temperature (a) and density (b-d) structure assumed indetermining subsidence in a stretched  basin.

Following stretching by $\beta$ thedensity  structure is: \begin{eqnarray} 			\rho_z =\rho_f 				&	0 < z < S_i\nonumber \\			\rho_z  = \rho_c\left(1Ê+Ê\alpha \, ÊT_mÊ\left(1Ê-Ê\frac{z\, \beta}{z_l} \right)\right)	&	S_i < z < Si + \frac{z_c}{\beta}\nonumber \\ 		\rho_z  = \rho_m \left(1Ê+Ê\alpha \,ÊT_mÊ\left(1Ê-Ê\frac{z\, \beta}{z_l} \right)\right) 	 & 	S_i  + \frac{z_c}{\beta}  <  z  < S_i + \frac{z_l}{\beta}\nonumber \\ 			\rho_z = \rho_m					& S_i + \frac{z_l}{\beta}  < z  <  z_l      \end{eqnarray} where $\rho_f$ is the density of the medium filling the riftbasin of thickness $S_i$. 	The condition of isostasy amounts to equating the verticalstress, $\sigma_{zz}$, at a common  depth, $z_l$, beneath the unstretched and stretchedbasin. Beneath the unstretched lithosphere  $\sigma_{zz}$  at $z_l$ is given by (allowingthat $\rho_c \, \alpha_c = \rho_m \, \alpha_m$):  	\begin{eqnarray} \label{eq:rift} 	\sigma_{zz} \mid_{z=z_l}  & =&  g \int_{0}^{z_l} \rho_z \,dz \nonumber \\ 			&	=&  g\, z_c \,\rho_c  +   g (z_l - z_c) \rho_m  + \frac{z_l}{2}\,gÊÊ\, \alphaÊ\,\rho_m\,ÊT_m   	  \end{eqnarray} Beneath the stretched basin $\sigma_{zz}$  at $z_l$ is given by:\begin{eqnarray}  \label{eq:subs} 			\sigma_{zz} \mid_{z=z_l}  &= &g \int_{0}^{z_l}\rho_z \,dz \nonumber \\ 		&		= &g\, \rho_f \,S_i  +    g\,Êz_c\,Ê\rho_c\, \beta   +  g\,Ê(z_lÊ-Êz_c)Ê\rho_mÊ\beta \nonumber \\   				  	&&+   \frac{g\,Êz_lÊ\, \alphaÊ\,\rho_mÊT_m}{ 2Ê\beta}    +  g\, \rho_m\left(z_lÊ-ÊS_iÊ-Ê\frac{z_l}{\beta}\right) 	\end{eqnarray} equating Eqn \ref{eq:rift} with Eqn \ref{eq:subs} and solving for $S_i$gives (Figure \ref{subs}): \begin{equation} S_i  = \left(\betaÊ-Ê1\right)Ê\left(Ê2\,Êz_cÊ\left(\rho_cÊ-Ê\rho_m\right)Ê+ÊT_mÊ\,\alpha\,Êz_l\,Ê\rho_m\,\right)Ê2\,Ê\beta\,Ê\left(\rho_fÊ-Ê\rho_m\right)Ê\end{equation}                                                      \begin{figure}[h,t,b]\label{subs} \vspace{2.3in} \hspace{0.7in} \special{epsf=:gdfigs:chap10:Fig10_3.epsscale=0.600}  \caption{ \protect\scriptsize{ Rift phase subsidence as a function ofstretching for a basin completely filled by sediment ($\rho_f$ =  2500 kg m$^{-3}$), andwater ($\rho_f$ = 1000 kg m$^{-3}$). }} \end{figure}\subsubsection{Sag Phase Subsidence} 	We assume that in the steady state the thickness ofthe lithosphere is dictated by  balancing the rate of heat flow through the lithospherewith the heat supplied to its base by the  convective motion in the interior. Anydeformation involving changes in the thickness of the lithosphere therefore induces adeparture  from this equilibrium condition which in turn influences the ensuing thermalevolution of the  lithosphere. Since heat loss is proportional to  the temperaturegradient in the lithosphere extensional deformation brings the asthenosphere closer to thesurface and  consequently increases the heat loss through the lithosphere  (Chapter 4).This imbalance causes heat to be lost  through the lithosphere more quickly than it issupplied. The consequent cooling and thickening  of the lithosphere causes it to becomemore dense, inducing a kind of thermal subsidence or  sag. There are two questions ofinterest here: \begin{itemize} 	\item what is the relationship between the stretchingfactor $\beta$ and the induced thermal  subsidence; and \item over what time scale doesthe thermal subsidence take place (this question will be  addressed in Section 10.4).\end{itemize} 	We can formulate the isostatic effects of the thermal or sag phasesubsidence, $S_t$,  following a stretching by a factor $\beta$ in the following manner.Following reestablishment of the  equilibrium lithospheric thickness, $z_l$, by conductiveheat loss the density distribution will be:  	\begin{eqnarray} 		\rho_z  =  \rho_f 			&&		0< z < S_t + S_i \nonumber \\ 			\rho_z  = \rho_c \left(1Ê+Ê\alpha\,ÊT_mÊ\left(1Ê-Ê\frac{z}{z_l}\right)\right) &&  		S_t + S_i < z < S_t + S_i + \frac{z_c}{\beta}\nonumber \\ 		\rho_z  = \rho_m  \left(1Ê+Ê\alpha\,ÊT_mÊÊ\left(1Ê-Ê\frac{z}{z_l}\right)\right) &&		S_t + S_i  + \frac{z_c}{\beta}  <  z  <  z_l   \end{eqnarray} where $S_t$ is the subsidence due to thermal sag. Letting the totalsubsidence, $S = S_t + S_i$, then  $\sigma_{zz}$ at $z_l$ beneath the saged basin is givenby: \begin{eqnarray}  			\sigma_{zz}|_{z=z_l}  &=&  g \int_{0}^{z_l}Ê\, \rho_z \,dz\nonumber \\ 				&=&   g Ê\, \rho_f\, S  +    gÊ\, z_cÊÊ\, \rho_c \, Ê\beta   +  \nonumber \\ && g Ê\,\rho_m \left(z_lÊ-ÊSÊ-Ê\frac{z_c}{\beta}	    +   \frac{ Ê\,z_lÊÊ\,\alpha \,ÊT_mÊ\ }{2}Ê\right)        \end{eqnarray} Solving for $S$ gives: \begin{equation} S  =   Ê\frac{z_cÊ(\betaÊ-Ê1)ÊÊ\left( \rho_cÊ-Ê\rho_m)\right)}{\betaÊ\left(\rho_fÊ-\rho_m\right)} \end{equation} and $S_t$ (Figure \ref{sag}):\begin{equation} S_t  =   \frac{T_mÊ\, \alpha\,Ê\rho_mÊ\,z_lÊ\,\left(\betaÊ-Ê1\right)}{2\,Ê\betaÊ\left(\rho_fÊ-Ê\rho_m\right)} \end{equation}\subsubsection{Heterogeneous stretching of the lithosphere} 	The $f_c-f_l$ diagrams (notethat $f$ is the reciprocal of $\beta$)  shown in Figure \ref{fcfl} allows the rift phasesubsidence to be calculated for any  inhomogeneous stretching deformation, in which thedeformation is not equally partitioned  between the crust and mantle (although in thesediagrams there has been no allowance made of  the density of the medium filling thedepressions).  \begin{figure}[h,t,b] \label{sag} \vspace{2.4in} \hspace{0.7in}\special{epsf=:gdfigs:chap10:Fig10_4.eps scale=0.600} \caption{\protect\scriptsize{Sagphase subsidence as a function of stretching for a basin completely filled by sediment($\rho_f =  2500 $  kg m$^{-3}$), and water ($\rho_f = 1000 $  kg m$^{-3}$)} }\end{figure}                                                           	The $f_{c}-f_{l}$Êparameterisation allows us to consider the isostatic effects of magma additions  to thecrust during extension, as for instance has occurred during stretching of the Basin and Range Province in the western USA. Magma additions add mass to the crust, with the resultthat   $f_{c}>Êf_{l}$Ê. In the Basin and Range Province magma addition appears to havebeen sufficent to  maintain a crustal thickness in the vicinity of 30 km, while theunderlying mantle part of the  lithosphere has been severely attenuated (Gans, 1988). Theresulting path shown in Figure \ref{fcfl}  explains the anomalously high elevation of theBasin and Range Province.  Finally, the isostatic  effects of stretching are dependent toa large extent on the vertical density structure of the  lithosphere prior to stretching.For typical continental lithosphere we have shown that  homogeneous (or pure shear)thinning results in subsidence. In contrast, Figure \ref{fcfl} shows  that homogeneousthinning of old oceanic lithosphere results in uplift or Ridge formation.  Indeed, this isexactly as we showed in Chapter 7, and this is exactly why  the ocean ridges are important engines for lithospheric motion and deformation.  \begin{figure}[h,t,b]\label{fcfl} \vspace{3in} \hspace{0.2in} \special{epsf=:gdfigs:chap10:Fig10_5.epsscale=0.700}  \caption{\protect\scriptsize{$f_{c}-f_{l}$Ê diagrams for stretching oftypical continental lithosphere ($z_c$ = 35 km, $z_l$ = 125 km, elevation  contours in 1km intervals) and typical oceanic crust ($z_c$ = 6 km, $z_l$ = 125 km, elevation contours in 0.5 km intervals). Note that homogeneous stretching of continental lithosphere leads to subsidence (elevation contours for subsidence assume no sedimentation or water filling,to change  to a filled basin multiply subsidence by $\rho_m/(\rho_m - \rho_f))$ whilehomogeneous stretching of oceans leads  to uplift (i.e., ridge formations).}} \end{figure}\section{Mechanical  consequences of extension} \subsubsection{Inttroduction} So far wehave treated basin formation in terms of a kinematic model only, that is  withoutconsideration of the forces that drive the deformation. In order to develop a mechanicalmodel  we must consider the thermal evolution of stretch basins  explicitly, because themechanical strength of the lithosphere is closely allied to its thermal state. We use themechanical model described in Chapter 2.\subsubsection{The time scale of thermal sag} 	As discussed in Chapter 4.3 a convenient measure of the response timeto thermal perturbations in media in which  heat is transported only by conduction isgiven by the thermal time constant, t: \begin{equation} \tau = \frac{l^2}{\pi^2Ê\,\kappa}\end{equation} where $l$ is the length scale over which the perturbation occurs, $\kappa$is the thermal diffusivity (units  m$^2$ s$^{-1}$). The thermal time constant provides ameasure of time for the decay of approximately  50\%  of the thermal perturbation, withmeasurable deacy occuring up until about 3  $\tau$. The thermal  time constant of thecontinental lithosphere is of the order of ~ 60 Ma ($\kappa =  10^{-6}$ m$^2$s$^{-1}$, $l= 10^5$  m), and thus we may expect that subsidence associated with sag of a rifted basinfor a period of  up to ~ 150-200 Ma (Figure \ref{temp}).	Since the decay of a thermal perturbation is proportional to the second derivative of the temperature gradient with respect to depth (Chapter 4) and is therefore  an exponentially decreasing function of time. Consequently, the thermal sag subsidence should also decline exponentially with time.                                   \begin{figure}[h,t,b]\label{temp} \vspace{3.2in} \hspace{1.2in} \special{epsf=:gdfigs:chap10:Fig10_6.epsscale=0.750} \caption{\protect\scriptsize{ Evolution of the geotherm during sag followinginstantaneous stretching at time $t = 0$.}} \end{figure} \subsubsection{ Thermal evolutionat finite extensional strain rates}	The instantaneous thinning of lithosphere will result in isothermal decompression of all material points in the lithosphere. The resultant increase in the geotherm for aninstantaneous  stretch is $\beta$. However, lithosphere stretched at finite rates willevolve geotherms lower than the  theoretical "instantaneous" geotherm for two reasons.with   important consequence for the  evolution of strength within the lithosphere\marginpar{\scriptsize{note that we were able to ignore these thermal  effects in our analysis of subsidencepresented in sections 9.2 and 9.3 because we assumed an  instantaneous stretch}}. \begin{itemize}\item	Firstly any stretching event will necessarily cause thevertically integrated  volumetric heat production of the lithosphere to diminish (by afactor of $\beta$ for homogenous  stretching events). Assuming a steady state geothermprior to stretching then the declining heat  production caused by stretching will lead tocooling of individual material points within the  lithosphere (Figure \ref{temptwo}), withthe amount of cooling for a given stretch inversely proportional  to the strain rate.                                              \begin{figure}[h,t,b] \label{temptwo}\vspace{3in} \hspace{1.2in} \special{epsf=:gdfigs:chap10:Fig10_7.eps scale=0.700}\caption{\protect\scriptsize{Stretching leads to an upward migration of isotherms, andthus an increase in the geotherm.  However, for finite stretching rates individualmaterial points cool (as shown by arrowed lines),  because the stretching reduces the heatproduction in any vertical column through the lithosphere  by the factor $\beta$ (thecooling is most pronounced in the crust where most of te heat producing  elements reside).This model shows the homogeneous stretching of a 100 km thick lithosphere by  $\beta$ =2.0 over 30 Ma ($\dot{\epsilon}_z =  2 x 10^{-15}$ s$^{-1}$).}} \end{figure}	\item Secondly, lithosphere stretched at finite rates will evolve geotherms lower than the theoretical "instantaneous" geotherm  because the processes of rifting and sagwill  overlap in time and space. The extent of overlap will depend on the both the strainrate and the  finite strain.  \end{itemize}\subsubsection {Mechanical Evolution } 	We have  shown thatconvergent deformation of the continental lithosphere induces  weakening due largely tothe increase of the Moho temperature associated with increasing heat production within the lithosphere. This provides a self localising mechanism for convergent orogens, withthe  length scales dictated by the rheology, strain rate relationship. Similarly thelength scales for  divergent deformation will be also controlled by rheology. Thelithosphere is, however, weaker  in tension than in compression because brittle failure intension occurs at lower stress difference  than in compression (Figure \ref{strength}). \begin{figure}[t,h,b]  \label{strength} \vspace{3in} \hspace{1.3in}\special{epsf=:gdfigs:chap10:Fig10_8.eps scale=0.750} \caption{\protect\scriptsize{Seetext for discussion}} \end{figure} Cconsequenlty, for an equivalent geotherm and strain rate the acrossstrike length scale of an extensional  orogen will  be significantly less thana compressional orogen.	For small initial finite stretches the lithosphere will undergo essentially isothermal decompression (Figure \ref{temptwo}). The consequent decrease in the depth  of the powerlaw failure  envelopes for quartz and olivine will induce a reduction in the strength ofthe lithosphere; a  form of thermal weakening (Figure \ref{strengthtwo}a). However,  withincreasingly large finite strains, the  cooling of material points as they aredecompressed (Figure \ref{strengthtwo}) ultimately leads to an  increase in wholelithospheric strength (Figure \ref{strengthtwo}). This analysis suggests that early intheir  evolution rift zones should be self-localising but gradually becoming moredistributed.  The point  at which the switch from  {\em weakening} to {\em strengthening}occurs depends critically on the  strain rate with the critical strain decreasing with decreasing strain rate.\subsubsection{The role of magmas} 	Of course the thermal and mechanical evolution ofextensional orogens is depenedent  not only on the rate of deformation but also on theinvolvement of asthenospheric magmatic  additions. Decompression of the asthenospherebeneath stretched lithosphere may induce  melting in an analogous fashion to meltingbeneath ridges. For the normal potential temperature  of the asthenosphere (1280$^o$C)this requires decompression of asthenosphere beneath depths of  approximately 45 km.Assuming initial lithospheric thicknesses of the order of 100 km or  more the minimum$\beta$ value required for melting of the mantle beneath the stretched lithsophere  is about2. Once melting occurs, the rapid advection of heat into the overlying lithosphere willcause  dramatic strength reductions, potentially overriding the strain hardeningassociated with large  strains mentioned in the previous section. Moreover, the isostaticconsequences of magma  addition are to increase the elevation of the lithosphere,  as isthe case in the Basin  and Range Province, potentially giving rise to extensional buoyancyforces which augment the  original driving forces for stretching. This magmaticallyaugmented weakening may be an  essential requirement for the complete rupturing ofstretched continental lithosphere to form  new spreading oceans.\subsubsection{The role of mantle plumes} In the discussion above we have not explicitlyconsidered the origin of the forces that drive extension of the continental lithosphere.While it is clear that compressional forces within the continents can be generated by  thetractions exerted by subducting slabs it is not at all clear that substantial extensionalforce may be exerted on normal thickness continetal lithosphere. This is because normalthickness lithosphere (35 km thick crust and 125 km thick lithosphere) is in approximatepotential energy balance with the mid-ocean ridges; that is the ridges seem to neitherexert compression nor tension on  normal continental lithosphere. Of course regions ofelevated topography within the continents, such as  associated with thickened crust formed in zones of compression, will naturally experience tension when the forces drivingconvergence are relaxed. Another important way of increasing the potential energy of thelithosphere may be through the impingement of a mantle plume  at the base of thelithosphere, which may have the effect of jacking up the lithosphere by as much as 1 km.The associated potential energy gain (for a column of unit area) is given  to a firstapproximation by: \begin{equation} U_{plume} = \frac{g \, \rho_c\, h^2}{2} \end{equation} where $h$ isthe additional elevation caused by the jacking effect of the mantle plume, and for crustaldensity $\rho_c$ = 2800 kg m$^{-3}$ is equivalent to a tensional force per unit length oftopography of about 1.4 x 10$^{12}$ N m$^{-1}$ for every km of additional elevation. An important additional effect of extension initiated by a plume relates to the highermantle temperatures which may be up to about 300$^o$C higher than the mean convectivemantle temperatures. The implication is  that decompression melting in the asthenospherewill begin at a much earlier stage in the rifting process. For example for a potentialmantle temperature of 1580$^o$C melting begins at about 120 km depth, implying that plumesmay begin generating melts without any appreciable deformation of the overlyinglithosphere. Moreover as mentioned in the previous section the transport of such meltsinto the lithosphere must further enhance the potential energy of the lithosphere andweakens  it in such a way to augment any extensional deformation that has already begun.                                                                    \begin{figure}\label{strengthtwo} \vspace{2.7in} \hspace{0.3in} \special{epsf=:gdfigs:chap10:Fig10_9.epsscale=0.650} \caption{\protect\scriptsize{Schematic representation of how lithosphericstrength changes as a function of stretching. For low  finite strains and/or high strainrates decompression is essentially isothermal and thus the plastic  failure envelopes moveto shallower depths (since they are dependent on temperature and thus only  indirectly ondepth through the geotherm - Eqn 5.2) inducing a reduction in lithospheric strength  by anamount equal to Area 1 + Area 3. A decrease in the depth of the Moho results in a strength increase by an amount  equivalent to Area 2. The net change in the lithospheric strengthis given  by Area 1 + Area 3 - Area 2. At low strain rates and/or high finite strainscooling of material  points occurs such that there is no rise in the plastic failureenvelopes with further deformation  (i.e., Area 1 and Area  3 tend to 0).The consequentstrain hardening is equivalent to Area 2. 	White and McKenzie (1989) point  out  that  inmantle upwelling zones the temperatures  may be in excess of ~ 100$^{\rm o}$C above thetypical potential temperature of the mantle. Stretching  above such abnormally hotasthenosphere will induce melting at rather lower b values than for  normal mantle, andfor a given b value contribute a much greater amount of melt to the  overlyinglithsophere. The variable magmatic history of extensioanl provibnces and rifted  marginsmay therefore relate to the thermal state of the subjacent convective interior during rifting. }} \end{figure}\section{Sedimentation in stretched basins}   	We have seenthat the evolution of rift basins can be viewed in terms of two distinct  phases: the riftphase, and the sag phase. In the the rift phase sedimentation is associated with the isostatic subsidence induced by the active deformation. Rift phase sediments show signs ofactive  tectonism, such as growth faults with rapid facies and thickness changes. Sagphase  sedimentation follows rift phase and represents the isostatic effects of freezingasthenosphere  onto the base of the thinned lithosphere as the geotherm returns to steadystate. Sag-phase  sediments are typically laterally extensive without abrupt facieschanges. Subsidence rates  decrease exponentially through the sag phase with acharacteristic time scale indicative of the  thermal time constant of the lithosphere.\subsubsection{The Steer's Head} 	Stretched basin stratigraphy commonly exhibits a Steer'sHead or Texas Longhorn shape  with the sag phase sediments extending beyond the zone ofobservable crustal stretching (Figure  8.9). This characteristic stratigraphy may be afunction of either the finite flexural rigidity of the  lithosphere or by differentialstretching of the crust and mantle parts of the lithosphere (White \&  Mckenzie, 1988).	In the calculations above we made the simplyfying assumption that the lithosphere is everywhere in local isostatic equilibrium. This amounts to treating the lithosphere asinfinitely  weak (to vertical shearing) and therefore  incapable of supporting bending orflexural stresses. The lithosphere is not   infinitely weak but rather has a finiteflexural  rigidity. The consequences of the finite flexural rigidity are that loads on thelithosphere, such as  sedimentary or tectonic loads, are generally compensated on aregional scale rather than a local  scale, with significant local departures fromisostatic equilibrium. In the case of the deposition of  sediment in rift basins thefinite flexural rigidity of the lithosphere allows compensation of the  sedimentary loadbeyond the zone of stretching allowing downward flexing of the lithosphere  beyond thestretched zone. Since the active rift phase is usually associated with a severe thermal perturbation the flexural rigidity of the lithosphere is expected to be very low duringactive  rifting. However cooling attendent with sag pahse subsidence will increase theflexural rigidity  causing the loading due to emplacement of sediment  to be compensatedon length scales which  increase with time (Figure \ref{steer}).                                                          \begin{figure}[h,t,b] \label{steer} \vspace{2in}\hspace{0.4in} \special{epsf=:gdfigs:chap10:Fig10_10.eps scale=0.700} \caption{\protect\scriptsize{Schematic cross section showing  characteristic steer's headformation of rift basins.} }\end{figure} 	White and McKenzie (1988) argue that the flexural rigidity of continental lithosphere is  insufficient to explain the Steer's Headgeometry and regard the characteristic geometry as a  function of heterogeneous stretchingof the lithosphere, with the characteristic length scale for  mantle stretching greaterthan the length scale for crustal stretching. Indeed there is no good  reason thatstretching should be homogeneous on the scale of the lithsophere, and the resulting values of $\beta_c$ and $\beta_l$  (the reciprocals of $f_c$ and $f_l - f_c$,respectively) are shown in Figure \ref{steertwo}.  This allows subdivision of the basininto three regions which show characteristic elevation  changes.

In the case where the normal faults are  planar, rather thanlistric, it is easy to calculate the finite extension, $\beta$, from the dip slope,$\theta$, as  well as the observed orientation of the faults, $\alpha$ (Figure\ref{dominotwo}) \begin{equation} \beta  =  \frac{l_i}{l_o}  = \frac{\sin\left(\thetaÊ+Ê\alpha\right)} {\sin(\alpha)}	 \end{equation}				                \begin{figure}[h,t,b] \label{domino} \vspace{2in} \hspace{0.3in}\special{epsf=:gdfigs:chap10:Fig10_12.eps scale=0.700} \caption{\protect\scriptsize{ Thedeformation of planar faults forming a set of dominoes requires rotation about ahorizontal axis  in order that strain compatibility be maintained.

The emergence of thefootwall  escarpments is due to the horizontal rotation component of tilting normal faultsets. Figure \ref{fulc}  shows schematically how the problem can  be conceptualised.Therotation of the dip slopes can  be understood as a rotation about a fulcrum. This is thepoint on the dip slope that in the absence  of any isostatically induced subsidence wouldremain at constant elevation. In fact this fulcrum  undergoes the calculated subsidence($S_i$) for the appropriate extension, $\beta$. The condition for an  emergent footwallescarpment is clearly that  $\Delta H > S_i$. For a given amount of extension (i.e., fixed $S_i$), $\Delta H$  will be proportional to the horizontal spacing of the faults. \begin{figure} \label{fulc} \vspace{1in} \hspace{0.5in}\special{epsf=:gdfigs:chap10:Fig10_14.eps scale=0.700} \caption{\protect\scriptsize{Seetext for discussion}} \end{figure} 	Despite the common assertion that normal fault systemsare listric (that is they curve to  shallower orientations at depth), there isconsiderable debate amongst seismologists as to whether  this is the case, with at leastone vociferous group (McKenzie, Jackson etc.) arguing that normal  fault sets aregenerally planar. In modern extensional fault systems normal faults tend to nucleate  ataround 60$^o$. With increased extension the fault sets rotate to shallower angles and seemto lock  at around 30$^o$. Futher extension must be accommodated by the formation of a newset of steeply  dipping (60$^o$) faults, which dissect an progressively rotate the olderinactive set.
