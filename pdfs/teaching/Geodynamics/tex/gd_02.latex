The mainfeatures of each of these {\em geophysical observables}  at the globalscale is summarised below.\section{Topography} At the global-scale the distribution of topography  is stronglybimodal (Fig. \ref{gtopo})  withcontinental topography having a mean elevation of several hundred mand ocean bathymetry having a mean depth of about -4 km. \begin{figure}[h,t,b]\includegraphics{../Figures/Chapter_02/Figure_hyps.jpg}%\label{gtopo}%\vspace{6.5in}%\hspace{-1.in}%\special{epsf=:gdfigs:chap6:Fig6_1.eps  scale=0.75}%\vspace{-2in}\caption{\protect Histograms of topographhy (and bathymetry) at the plateand global scales.} \end{figure}\subsubsection{Morphology of the ocean floor}	The floors of the ocean basins have a relatively simply morphology(at least when considered at long wavelengths, being dominated bynarrow  ridges  (the mid-ocean ridges), abyssal plains and trenches.The mid-ocean ridges represent submerged  volcanic mountain ranges,with an average depth beneath sea level of 2--3 km. Broad swells in the elevation of the ridges occur along their length and locally theridges are exposed, as is the  case in Iceland. The depth of the oceanfloor increases systematically away from the ridges,  corresponding totime dependent changes in the density structure of the upper mantlebeneath  the ageing oceanic lithosphere, as reflected for example in the geoid (see Section 7.1). The depthbeneath the ridges above  40 Ma oceanic crust   is about 2 km, whilefor 80 Ma old oceanic crust  it is about 3 km. The average depth ofthe  ocean waters is therefore clearly related to the age of theoceanic lithosphere, which in turn is  related to the rate ofgeneration (spreading rate) of new oceanic lithosphere at ridges (see Section 5.2). In trenches, which mark the sight of subduction of oldoceanic lithosphere water depths may reach 10 km.This regular pattern of oceanic bathymetry is disturbed by:\begin{itemize}\item {\em Guyots and sea-mounts}From the point of view of the history ofunderstanding seafloor evolution, now submerged, but once exposed,oceanic seamounts termed {\em guyots} are an important morphologicalfeature of the ocean basins. \marginpar{\scriptsize{Menard provides an excellentfirst hand account in his book {\em An ocean of truth} of thesignificance of these drowned-islands on the development of sea-floorspreading hypotheses.}} These features show, unequivocally, that thechange in bathymetry  of the mean sea-floor  with distanceform the ridge corresponds to a temporal sequence of subsidence, andthus coroborates the interpretation of sea-floor spreading based on theobserved symmetrical magnetic striping of the ocean floors.\item {\em Fracture zones}\end{itemize} \subsubsection{Continental topography}The continents have a mean elvation of several hundered meters abovesea-level with a range   from about 300 meters belowsea-level (at the break in the continental shelf) up to about 8 km atMt. Everest. At the 100 km - scale,the highest average elevation isonly 5 km.  Continental landscapes provide one of the most dramatic of naturalfractal surfaces. The characteristic feature of the fractal is thestatitiscal scale-invariance, that is the general character of thesurface looks the same independent of the scale of observation. Forlandscapes this is strictly true only over a limited range of scales(10$^{-1}$m -- 10$^5$ m).   The  invariance of landscapes on thisrange of scales suggests that the processes operating to sculpt thelandscape (i.e., erosion, mass wastage and deposition) are eitherscale-invariant themselves or that when acting together produce the scale-invariant effect.Erosion acts to roughen landscape at a wide range of scales whileboth mass wastage and deposition act to smooth the landscape, at theshort and long-wavelength, respectively. \marginpar{\scriptsize{See  Chase (1992),{\em  Geomorphology}.}}	\section{The geoid}\includegraphics{../Figures/Chapter_02/Figure_geoid.jpg}Because of the inviscid nature of water(when viewed at geological time-scales) the mean  sea-levelrepresents   gravitational equipotential surface inthe earths gravitational field and therefore its elevation can berelated to the density distribution at depth (as well as the theorbital dynamics of the Earth which cause an ellipticity  in massdistribution and hence in  the equipotential surfaces). The observedgeoid height, as  determined from  the mean sea-level elevation, isexpressed in terms of an anomaly relative to  some fixed elevation(i.e., the predicted geoid for an idealised sphercially symmetric,rotating mass distribution). Variations in the  gravitational potential energy of the lithosphere, $\Delta U_l$,  correlate with the dipole moment of the near-surface density distribution and therefore they can be directly related to thelithospheric component of the observed  geoid anomalies, $\Delta N_l$  :  \[ \Delta U_l =   \frac{g^2} {2 \, \pi \,G} \,\Delta N_l \]where $g$ is the gravitational acceleration, and $G$ is the gravitationalconstant (note that the potential energy varies with the geoid anomaly as approximately 0.23   x $10^{12}$ N m$^{-1}$ per meter). The main problem with using this relationship is resolving thelithospheric contribution of the geoid anomalies from the much largeramplitude anomalies associated with the dynamic processes of plate tectonicsand mantle convection.Positive geoid anomalies of  up to  10 -- 15 m  associated with a number ofmid-ocean ridge segments, as well asage-correlated geoid offsets across fracture zones imply thatageing of the ocean lithosphere is accompanied by a decline in potentialenergy.  The geoidanomaly predicted for the cooling half-space model (as well as the thermal plate model)for young ocean lithosphere isabout  $d \, \left(\Delta N_o \right)/d \,t = - 0.15 $ m/Ma,which  compares favourably with  the observed geoid anomaly over theMid-Atlantic Ridge at 44.5$^{\rm o}$N,  and elsewhere,  as well as  with the geoid offsets across fracture zones. The total geoid anomaly of -12.7 m over 84 Ma  corresponds decline in $U_l$ of 2.9 x $10^{12}$ N m$^{-1}$.In comparison with the mid-ocean ridges, the geoid anomalies associated withcontinental margins and the interior of continents are far less clear.  On the basis of averages taken over large areas there appears to be no systematic difference in the geoid heightbetween old ocean basins (older than Cretaceous) and continental masses.  Such aninterpretation implies that the mean potential energy of the continentallithosphere is equivalent to old ocean basins. However, the data show very substantial differencesbetween  continents, with the mean geoid of the  African continent  some 40 m higherthan the North American continent and 10 m higher than the mean for the Atlantic and Pacific ocean basins older than Cretaceous. This observed  intercontinental variationfar exceeds the plausible  lithospheric contributions to geoid anomalies and therefore must reflectlong-wavelength sub-lithospheric contributions. Moreover, a number of continental margins arecharacterized by distinct positive anomalies of the order  6 m  across thetransition from the ocean basin to sea-level continent  and imply that a continental lithospheric column supporting sealevel elevation  has the potential energy equivalent to ocean lithosphere of ageabout 44 Ma.  Since the lithospheric contribution to thegeoid anomaly reflects the dipole moment of the near-surface densitydistribution, the observed geoid anomalies across continental margins can also be used toconstrain the  continental lithospheric density structure.A lithospheric thickness of 125 km and acrustal density of 2750 kg /m$^3$ is consistent with a continental marginal geoidanomaly of + 6 m. Moreover, such a density structure is consistent with theinterpretation that an isostatically compensated  continental lithospheric columnsupporting about 1  km of surface elevation above sea level is in potentialenergy balance with the mid-ocean ridges. While the generally poor resolution of the geoid in mountainous regions precludesdefinitive correlation between topography and potential energy within thecontinents, some evidence of the    correlation  is provided by the lithospheric contribution to the geoid anomaly of 24 -- 27 m for the  AndeanAltiplano. Such inferences are consistent with a geoid that varieswith continental topography as 6 -- 7 m/km, corresponding to a potential energyvariation of about 1.3 x $10^{12}$ N m$^{-1}$. For a continent with an average  elevation of  500m, this   correlation suggests a mean continental potential energy of  0.997 x $U_{MOR}$\section{Heat flow}Since the lithosphere represents a conductive lid to mantle convectionthe variation in heat flow measured at the surface provides insightinto the vertical structure of the lithosphere.In the ocean lithosphere, the highest heat flow regions are associatedwith mid-ocean ridges, where absolute values are very variable(50-300 mW m$^{-2}$) due to intense, but localised, hydrothermalactivity. In older, deeper lithosphere the heat flow measurementsbecome less variable and gradually decline. The decline in heat flowapproximates the same dependence on t$^{0.5}$ as bathymetry. This {\emage-bathymetry-heatflow} law for ocean lithosphere which provides oneof the most profound insights into the structure of the lithosphere(see Chapter 7).\section{Active seismicity}The distribution of seismicity in the lithosphere provides a direct"snapshot" of the active deformation. \section{The {\it in-situ} stress field}The orientation of the stress field in the lithsophere provides animprtant constraint on mechanisms driving plate motion (see Chapter10).%\begin{figure}[h,t,b]%\label{}%\vspace{0in}%\hspace{0in}%\special{epsf=:gdfigs:chap6:Fig6_x.ps  scale=1.0}%\caption{\protect\scriptsize{ }}%\end{figure}
