Indeed, it is this very heat loss that     is responsible for lithospheric growthand ultimately provides the  energy source  driving the motions of the   lithosphere.  Heat loss from the Earth's interior is accompanied   both by conduction and advection,which  can be simply codified in terms of the   requirement for the conservation of energy - and which therefore can serve to  illustrate one of the great conservation principles ofphysics. \footnote{ Conservation principles  express the simple reality of{\em what goes in must come out!}}\section{Conduction and advection}  Thermal energy may be transported in two fundamentally different modes; namely byconduction and by advection. In the former heat diffuses through matter while in the latterit is carried by the physical transport of matter.\subsection*{Conduction} Everyday experience witnesses the fact that thermal energy is transferred from hot bodiesto cool bodies, with the rate of thermal energy transfer, or heat flow,  dependent on thenature of the material. Fourier postulated that the heat flow,  $q$, is  proportional tothe negative of the temperature gradient, because heat flows down temperature gradients, with the  constant  of proportionality given by a material dependent parameter known as theconductivity, {$k$}, a postulate consistent with most subsequent experimentalinvestigation: 	 \begin{equation} \label{eq:heatflow}  q = -k\, 		{\rm	grad} \, T\end{equation} \footnote{\scriptsize{In a three-dimensional orthogonal co-ordinate system,$x$, $y$, $z$,  grad $T$ is:  \[ {\rm grad} \,T = \nabla T \] \[ \, \, \, \, =\left(\frac{\partial{T}}{\partial{z}}, \frac{\partial{T}}{\partial{y}},\frac{\partial{T}}{\partial{z}}\right) \] That is, the gradient of T is perpendicular tothe planes of constant temperature or isotherms. }}   Written in this form grad $T$signifies the gradient of $T$ (often written in the equivalent  form $ \nabla T$) and assuch is a  vector operator. That is, grad defines the magnitude and direction of thegradient of a scalar quantity such as temperature. \subsection*{Advection} The physical motion of material results in advective transport of heat. Using a {\em Eulerian description} it is easy to see that the rate of heat advectedthrough a fixed point  is dependent on the velocity of materialtransport and the temperature gradient.\footnote{\  In many problems in fluid mechanics we can distinguish between aEulerian and Lagrangian description. In the former, the description is in terms of a fixedspatial reference frame through which the fluid flows while in the latter the description is in terms of a moving reference frame attached to individual fluid particles. } Thus, as either the tempertaure gradient or the velocity tends to zero, the rate of heat advection must also tend to zero.\section{The thermal energy balance}	 In order to understand the thermal evolution of material subject to conductive heattransfer it is necessary to derive the thermal energy balance that expresses thefundamental physical constraint provided by the requirement of {\em conservation ofenergy}. Ignoring the advection of heat through the movement of the medium then the thermalenergy balance in a control volume can be expressed simply as:  \begin{center}  {\it  rateof gain of thermal energy 	\\  =  	\\  rate of thermal energy flowing into the controlvolume  	\\  - \\  rate\, of thermal energy flowing out of control volume  	\\ + 	\\  rateof heat production in control volume}  \end{center}		 \begin{equation} \label{tbalance}\end{equation} Since the thermal energy of a volume of unit dimensions is given by: \[ C_p\, \, \rho \, \, T  \] where $C_p$ is the heat capacity,  the first term in Eqn\ref{tbalance},  the {\it rate of gain of thermal energy}, can be expressed simply as  \[\frac{\partial{\left( C_p\,  \rho\,  T \right)}} {\partial{t}}\]  which for temperatureindependent $\rho $ and $C_p$ is equivalent to  \[ C_p \,\rho \,\frac {\partial{T}}{\partial{t}} \]  The difference between the second and third terms in Eqn\ref{tbalance} gives the negative of the divergence of the heat flow across the boundary ofthe control volume:  \[- {\rm div}\, q  \] \footnote{\scriptsize{The divergence of avector field such as $q$ is a scalar quantity and can be expresses equivalently as \[ {\rmdiv} \,q = \nabla \cdot \, q =   \frac{\partial{q_x}}{\partial{x}} +		\frac{\partial{q_y}}{\partial{y}} + \frac{\partial{q_z}}{\partial{z}} \]}} Note that thenegative sign arises because divergence actually  measures the rate of loss whereas in Eqn\ref{tbalance} we are really interested in the rate of gain (or   convergence). Assumingthat $k$ is independent of $T$ then the difference between the second and third terms inEqn \ref{tbalance} can be expressed in terms of T in the following way by substituting theexpression for $q$ given in Eqn \ref{eq:heatflow}:  \begin{eqnarray*} &   k\, {\rm div}\,\left({\rm grad} \, T \right)& = k \,\nabla \cdot \left(\nabla T \right)\\ &&=   k \left(\frac{\partial{^2T}}{\partial{x^2}} + \frac{\partial{^2T}}{\partial{y^2}} +\frac{\partial{^2T}}{\partial{z^2}}\right)  \end{eqnarray*} The final term in Eqn\ref{tbalance} is given by: \[ \rho \, H  \] where {$H $} is the  heat production per unitmass. Thus the thermal energy balance given by Eqn \ref{tbalance} can be given in the followingways: \begin{eqnarray}  \label{diffusion} &\frac{\partial{T}}{\partial{t}} &= \kappa\left({\rm div} \,\left( {\rm grad}\, T\right)\right) +\frac{H}{C_p} \nonumber \\  && =\kappa\left(\nabla \cdot \nabla T\right) + \frac{H}{C_p} \nonumber \\  && =\kappa\left(\frac{\partial{^2T}}{\partial{x^2}} + \frac{\partial{^2T}}{\partial{y^2}} +\frac{\partial{^2T}}{\partial{z^2}}\right) + \frac{H}{C_p} \end{eqnarray} where $\kappa$ isthe thermal diffusivity: \[\kappa = \frac{k}{\rho\, C_p} \] The  various forms  of thethermal energy balance in Eqn \ref{diffusion} form the {\em diffusion equation} or,alternatively, the heat equation.The {\em diffusion-advection equation} appropriate to whole rock advection, is obtained byadding an additional term to  Eqn \ref{diffusion} which expresses the rate at which heat isadvected through a point. This advective contribution is  given by the product of thevelocity and the temperature gradient, giving:  \begin{equation}  \label{difad}\frac{\partial{T}}{\partial{t}} = \kappa \nabla^{2}T - v .\nabla \,T + \frac{H}{ C_p}\end{equation} where the second term on the right is the {\em advective} term. For many  purposes, it is useful to recast Eqn \ref{difad} in a dimensionless  form:\begin{equation} \label{ddifad} \frac{\partial{T'}}{\partial{t'}} =   \nabla^{2}T' - Pe_T\,\nabla \,T'  \end{equation} where the dimensionless variable $T'$ and  $t'$  are given by \[ T' = T/T_0\]  \[ z' = z/l \] \[ t' =  t \kappa/ l^2 \] where $l$ is the appropriate length-scale  (for example, the thickness of the lithosphere),  and  $T_0$ is the characteristic temperature difference at the appropriate length-scale.   %(see Appendix A.2 for the non-dimensionalisation procedure).  In Eqn\ref{ddifad} $Pe_T$ is the thermal Peclet number which is a dimensionless variable \[ Pe_T =\frac{v \, l }{\kappa} \]. The Peclet number expresses  the  ratio of the advective to diffusive terms.  For $Pe_T > 10$ the advectiveterm dominates the thermal evolution and diffusion can be largely ignored,  while for $Pe_T <1$ diffusion dominates and the advective term can be largely ignored. For $1 < Pe_T < 10 $ both diffusion and advection contribute to the thermal evolution.\section{Thermal time constants} It is useful to define  the characteristic diffusive  response time to  thermalperturbations when heat is transferred by conduction.  For example consider a bunsen burnerapplied to the base of a conducting plate (geologically, this is analagous   to theimpingement of a mantle plume on the base of the lithosphere). We are interested in howlong  does it takes for the top surface to feel the effect of the perturbed lower boundarycondition.  Clearly the response time  depends on    the length-scale (i.e. the thicknessof the plate) and (inversely) on the thermal conductivity (or, equivalently, diffusivity). In this problem we can ignore the effects if internal heat production (which does notchange the response time to a change in boundary conditions).  From Eqn \ref{diffusion} theterm on the right,  $\frac{\partial{T}}{\partial{t}}$, gives the order the temperaturedivided by the timescale for thermal response,  $\tau$. Similarly the frist term on theright of Eqn \ref{diffusion}, $\kappa\left( {\rm div} \,\left( {\rm grad}\,T\right)\right)$, is of order $\kappa T/ l^2$, where $l$ is the appropriate length scale.Equating the two quantities gives : \[ \tau \propto \frac{l^2}{\kappa} \] The constant ofproportionality normally used is $1/\pi^2$ giving: \[ \tau = \frac{l^2}{\pi^2 \,\kappa} \]For the lithosphere typical parameter values are $l = 125$ km and $\kappa = 10^{-6}$ m $^2$s$^{-1}$ giving $\tau$ = 50 Ma. An important feature of the thermal time constant is its dependence on $l^2$.  For thelithosphere  this  implies that short wavelength  fluctuations are damped on timescaleswhich are very short compared to  lithospheric-scale perturbations (and,  incidently,explains why a 3 m deep cellar is insensitive to seasonal atmospheric temperaturefluctuations).\section{Continental geotherms}  In the steady-state, that is when $\frac{\partial{T}}{\partial{t}} = 0$, and when heat flowis only in one direction, z, Eqn \ref{diffusion} reduces to the ordinary differentialequation: \begin{equation} \label{geot} 0 = k\,\frac{d^2 T}{d \, z^2} + \rho \, H\end{equation} which can be readily integrated with appropriate boundary conditions toyield  a geotherm. For example,  assuming a constant distribution of heat producingelements  with depth, Eqn \ref{geot} can be integrated using the boundary conditionsappropriate to the continental lithosphere: {$					q  = - q_{s}    $}	at  {$  	z = 0 $}(i.e., the heat flow at the surface of the lithosphere in the direction of increasing depth is the negative of the surface heat flow), and  			{$		T  = T_{s}    		$}	at  {$ 	 	z= 0$} (i.e., the temperature at the top of the lithosphere is the surface temperature). Theresulting integration yields the expression 					\begin{equation} T_{z}  =  T_{s}  +  \frac{q_{s}\, z}{k}  -  \frac{\rho\, H\, z^{2}}{2 k} \end{equation} 			relating thetemperature at any depth, {$z$}, to the conductivity, surface temperature, {$T_{s}$},surface heat flow, {$q_{s}$}, and heat production, {$H$}. 	 The base of the lithosphere isdefined by the temperature sensitive rheological properties of peridotite and can thereforebe treated as an isotherm, {$T_{l} = 1280^{o} C$}. The heat flow at the surface of thelithosphere, {$q_{s}$}, therefore reflects the thickness of the lithosphere as well as thedistribution of heat sources within the lithosphere.\section{Natural convection}Natural convection \footnote{ Natural convection is distinguished from forcedconvection where the convective motion is induced by   "stirring".}  is the motion inducedby thermally created density gradients in viscous materials, otherwise known as fluids. \footnote{  In this sense the term {\it fluid} incorporates viscous solids, aswell as liquids and gases.}   In the presence of gravitational field a compositionallyhomogeneous fluid  heated from below will develop an unstable density stratification. Onceconvective motion is initiated and hotter, less dense material are juxtaposed against cooler more dense material by slight upward displacement (and vice versa in a downwellingzone)  the motion will be maintained by buoyancy forces operating on the individual fluidpackets  (Figure 3.1).  Counteracting the tendency to rise will be the viscous drag of thematerial and the tendency for the rising material to loose heat to its surroundings bythermal diffusion (Figure  3.2 \& 3.3).  Whether convective motion is initiated depends thematerial properties (thermal  diffusivity, coefficient of thermal expansion, viscosity). The likelihood of convective motion  will be enhanced by the fluid having a highcoefficient of thermal expansion, subject to a large  temperature gradient over a largevertical extent and diminished by a high thermal diffusivity or  by high viscosity. Initiation of the convective motion requires a finite amplitude perturbation  of thethermal, and hence density, structure in order to localize upwelling and or downwelling.                                            \hspace{2 cm} \includegraphics{Figures/Chapter_05/Figure_01.jpg} \begin{figure}[h,t,b] %\vspace{2.5in} \hspace{0.7in} \special{epsf=:gdfigs:chap4:Fig4_1.epsscale=0.700}  \caption{  For the initiation of convection an imbalanceof forces is required.  A fluid layer subject to an  inverted density gradient due, forexample, to basal heating and/or surface cooling is capable of  undergoing convection.Slight upward displacement of part of the basal layer will produce a  horizontal densitygradient which will lead to a net upward directed buoyancy force on the displaced  fluidparcel, further enhancing the prospect for upward motion and eventually fully developed convective motion. Initiation of the convective motion requires a finite amplitudeperturbation of  the thermal and hence density structure in order to localize upwelling andor downwelling.  } \end{figure} \hspace{2 cm} \includegraphics{Figures/Chapter_05/Figure_02.jpg} \begin{figure}[h,t,b] %\vspace{2.5in} \hspace{0.7in} \special{epsf=:gdfigs:chap4:Fig4_2.eps scale=0.700} \caption{  Thedisplacement of a parcel of hot light fluid is resisted by viscous dissipation or drag inthe  surrounding fluid (strictly the rate at which momentum diffuses into the surroundingmedium), a  measure of which is given by the kinematic viscosity of the fluid. }\end{figure}The Rayleigh number, $Ra_{T}$, is a measure of the relative magnitude of the destabilizing buoyancy forces (Figure 7.1)  and the stabilizing effects  of momentum and heat diffusion (Figure 7.2 \& 7.3) and is given by: \begin{equation} Ra_{T}  =  \frac{gÊ\,\alpha\,\DeltaT\,ÊL^{3}}{\kappa \,Ê\nu} 	 \end{equation} Where $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity (ms$^{-2}$), $\alpha$ is the coefficient of thermal expansion    ($^{o}K^{-1}$), $\delta T$is the temperature difference across the fluid layer ($^{o}$K), $L$ is the vertical lengthof the  system (m), $\kappa$ is the thermal diffusivity (m$^2$ s$^{-1}$) and $\nu$ is thekinematic viscosity of the fluid (m$^{2}$  s$^{-1}$). The kinematic viscosity is the ratioof the  viscosity $\mu$ to the density $\rho$.  \begin{displaymath}  \nu  = \frac{\mu}{\rho}	 \end{displaymath} A measure of the relative thickness of the viscous andthermal boundary layers and is given by  the Prandtl number, $Pr$ : \begin{equation}  Pr  = \frac{\nu}{\kappa}			 \end{equation} Note that both the Rayleigh and Prandtl numbers aredimensionless.  When the Prandtl number  is large the fluid diffuses momentum relativelyfaster than it does heat.  In such a  fluid the  slow diffusion of heat from a verticalboundary into the fluid produces a thin layer of hot, low  viscosity thermal boundary layeradjacent to the walls. Through the rapid dissipation of  momentum, the buoyancy of thislayer will drag more fluid into motion with the result that the  thickness of the viscousboundary layer is much greater than the thermal boundary layer. In a system in which thetemperature gradient is between  horizontal surfaces, the critical Rayleigh number for theonset of convection is  Ra$_T$ = 10$^3$.                                            \hspace{2 cm} \includegraphics{Figures/Chapter_05/Figure_03.jpg} \begin{figure}%[h,t,b] \vspace{2.5in} \hspace{0.7in} \special{epsf=:gdfigs:chap4:Fig4_3.eps scale=0.700} \caption{  Displaced packets of fluids are no longer inthermal equilibrium with the surrounds and thus gain  or lose heat at a rate proportionalto the thermal diffusivity of the fluid. For large diffusivities the  thermal equilibrationtakes place quickly thereby annihilating the density contrasts that drive the  convectivemotion. } \end{figure}\newpageThe geometrical form of convection in 3-dimensions may vary considerably with the  physicalproperties of the fluid. \footnote{See  Velarde and Normand, 1980, {\em Scientific American} who  provide  an exccellent introduction to natural convection.}   However,in all cases continuity requirements dictate a general self-similar organization. At initiation buoyancy forces induce upward motion of the heated fluid and  due to thecontinuity  requirement \footnote{\scriptsize{Continuity refers to the basic requirement of\em{conservation of mass.}}} simultaneously cooling parts of the fluidbody must begin  to sink. These opposite motions obviously cannot  occur  at the same placeand the convective  motion must organize itself into convection cells. Upwelling (anddownwelling) zones may  either be planar or columnar in form.Two types of fluid flow in convection can be defined; laminar or turbulent. Conditions forthese two modes are  described by the Reynolds number, $Re$ (again a dimensionlessparameter): \begin{equation} Re = \frac{wÊ\, d}{\nu	}			 \end{equation} where $w$ is the meanvelocity of the fluid (m s$^{-1}$), $d$ is the width or diameter of the source ($m$),  and$\nu$ the kinematic viscosity (m$^{2}$ s$^{-1}$). If  not confined to a pipe then flowbecomes turbulent at  values of $Re > 100$.  Confined flow requires much higher values ($Re= 2000$) to become   turbulent.  The nature of this flow is clearly important during anysort of process of mixing  since turbulence leads to much more efficient exchange of heatand material between two fluids. 	Convective mixing in laminar flow regimes, as appropriateto the  mantle, is ultimately a process of stretching and folding. During this mixingprocess initial compositional heterogeneities must thin with time, eventually tothe extent that  diffusional exchange is capable of complete homogenisation andequilibration with the host. At temperatures close tothose of the liquidi of magmas,  convective flow in  magma chambers will be vigorous andturbulent and under these  circumstances both efficient mixing and wall-rock exchange is tobe expected.  As a magma  body cools towards its solidus, it will change to laminar flowand eventually cease to convect.Plate tectonics is in part a consequence of thermal convection in the mantle largely drivenby  radiogenic heat sources as well as residual heat generated due to the release ofgravitational energy during core-mantle separation early in earth history.   In contrast, convection does not occur in the interior of the geologically inactive planetary bodieslike the  Moon and, most probably, Mars. The rate and geometry of mantle convection controlthe rate  of heat flow from the earth's interior to its surface, the rate at which crustalextraction takes  place and the rate at which material is recycled via subduction.  Anyfully developed  geodynamic hypothesis must therefore address the nature of mantleconvective geometry in the present earth.   	Convection requires viscous flow ordeformation.    Clearly liquids or gases flow at rates observable on the scale of humanpatience  however the asthenosphere is also capable of viscous flow albeit with very slowstrain rates (of  the order of $10^{-13} - 10^{-15}$s$^{-1}$).  The very high viscosity ofthe asthenosphere ($10^{20} - 10^{22}$ poise)  leads to the possibility of Rayleigh numbersappropriate for convection only when  coupled  with the very large length scales ofappropriate to the mantle thickness (note that the $Ra_{T}$  increases as a function of thecube of the length scale, but decreases only to the first power of  viscosity). 	Convectionof at least the upper part of the asthenosphere is probable on the grounds of  the relativehomogeneity of MORB suggesting a quite well mixed source. This conclusion is  alsosuggested by the timescale and efficiency of extraction of the lithophile elements to the crust from the depleted upper mantle. Systems such as the Earth with substantial density stratification organise themselves into discrete layeredsystems. These layers may show internal convection  with little material, but significant thermal energy,  exchange across layer boundaries. In this case, heat transfer between a lower denser system and the base of an overlying layer will be mediated by conduction through a thermal boundary layer. This situation occurs in the Earth at the core-mantle boundaryat the so-called D'' (or double prime) layer. Here, the very dense metallic core heats the base of the silicate mantle resultingin  periodic, thermally-induced, gravitational instabilities (Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities).When these instabilities achieve critical positive bouyancy they initiate the ascent of aplume of hot mantle material.
