However, some of the mostimpressive large scale features of orogenic belts are much more regular thantheir internal structural geometry.  For example, the topography of orogenicbelts, while very fragmented (fractal) on small scales, is very regular atthe scale of the orogenic belt.  Indeed, just as an understanding on thecontrol on topographic variation in the ocean basins provides fundamentalinsights, understanding the controls on topography provides very importantinsights into the mechanics of continental orogens.  We begin by examiningthe controls and some consequences of topography and potential enegrgy usingsimple calculations based on the assumption of local isostatic equilibrum. This assumption is only likely to be valid for thermally mature orogenicsystems which have started to develop plataeus (e.g., Tibet) or, inextension, wide basins, in which the deformation of the lithsophere is induced by forces applied as {\em end loads}.  The margins of orogenic belts involving wedge shapedthrust belts are certainly not in isostatic equilbrium and so the topographicvariation in such circumstances need to  be evaluated using  a differnet set of {\em boundary conditions}. To tackle the mechanics of the frontal parts ofmountain belts, and accretionar wedges, we need to investigate the dynamics of {\em critical wedges}, where the driving forces are imparted to the deforming  crust as {\em basal tractions} along some kind of master thrust or  decollement.   \section{Deformation of the lithosphere subject to an end load} Any consideration of thebehaviour of the continental lithsophere during deformation  needs torecognise the contrasting influence of the crust and the mantle lithospherein mediating both the thermal and isostatic response: \begin{itemize}\item{\em The crust} represents the buoyant part of the lithosphere as wellas the  part where lithospheric heat production is concentrated. Thickeningof the crust therefore   increases the buoyancy and potential energy of thelithospheric column, as well as   steepening the   geotherm through theincrease in the heat production in the thickened column. \marginpar{\scriptsize{Note that any increase in the geotherm accompanying  thermal equilibration of the thickened lithosphere   may takeconsiderable time following deformation (i.e, 50 Ma).}}\item{\em The mantle lithosphere}represents the dense negatively buoyant part of   the lithosphere, which isrelatively devoid of heat producing elements. Thickening of  the mantlelithosphere therefore reduces the buoyancy and potential energy  of the isostatically equilibrated column as well suprressing the geotherm in the overlying crustby reducing the heat flow into the base of the crust.\end{itemize} Because of this contrasting  influence  it is useful to consider the effectsof the  crust and mantle lithosphere, independently.  This can be achieved bydescribing the deformation of the lithosphere by the ratio of the changes inthickness of the crust, $f_c$, and mantle lithosphere, $f_m$, \marginpar{\scriptsize{In terms of these parameters the change in thickness of thetotal lithosphere $f_l$ as used by Sandiford \& Powell, 1990 etc. is given by $ f_l = f_m + \psi \left( f_c - f_m \right)] $where $\psi = z_{c0}/z_{l0}$.}} where these aredefined at any stage of the deformation  by: \[ f_c = \frac{z_c}{z_{c0}} \]\[ f_m = \frac{z_m}{z_{m0}} \] where $z_c$ and $z_m$ are the deformedthickness of the crust and mantle lithosphere, respectively, and $z_{c0}$ and$z_{m0}$ are the initial thickness of crust and mantle lithosphere  prior todeformation.\subsection*{Airy Isostasy and crustal thickening}Assuming Airy isostasy then crustal thickening results in both an increase in surface elevation, $c_h$, and thethe development of the crustal root, $c_r$.\begin{figure}[h,t,b] \label{cthick}\includegraphics{Figures/Chapter_09/Figure_01.jpg}% \vspace{3.0in} \hspace{0.0in}%\special{epsf=:gdfigs:chap9:Fig9_1.eps scale=0.73}\caption{\protect\scriptsize{ Isostatic effects of crustal thickening. }}\end{figure}For a crust  of constant density, $\rho_c$,overlying mantle of density $\rho_m$, the ratio of the change in surface elevation $c_h$ to the thickness of the crustal root $c_r$ is given by \[ \frac{c_h}{c_r} = \frac{\rho_m - \rho_c}{ \rho_c}\]The change in crustal thickness is given by the sum of $c_h + c_r$:\[ f_c = \frac{c_h + c_r + z_{c0}}{z_c0}\]giving\[ c_r = f_c \,z_{c0}- c_h - z_{c0} \] Therefore\[c_h = z_{c0}\left(1 -f_c \right) \left(\frac{\rho_c-\rho_m}{\rho_c} \right)\]Note that the change in surface elevation  is linear in the change in crustal thickness; that is, it is  linear in $f_c \, z_{c0}$.The change in potential energy $U_c$ for this scenario is given by:\[ U_c =  \frac{g \, \rho_c}{2}\left(\left(z_{c0}\,f_c\right)^2 -z_{c0}^2 - 2\, c_r^2\right) - \frac{g \,\rho_m}{2}c_r^2   \]Note that potential energy changes with the square of the  crustal thickening.The effects of crustal thinning (i.e., $f_c < 1$) are exactly opposite crustal thickening, that is it results in subsidence and a reduction in potential energy(see Chapter 10). \subsection*{Airy Isostasy and the mantle lithosphere}See Sandiford \& Powell (1990) {\em EPSL} \marginpar{\scriptsize{ Earth and Sanitary Appliance Letters}}\section{Deformation within the lithosphere due to basal tractions}
