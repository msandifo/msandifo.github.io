Since the great proportion of old oceanic lithosphere iscold mantle peridotite, after some critical  time the oceanic lithosphere mustbecome more dense than the hotter peridotite of the subjacent  convectiveasthenosphere thus allowing the possibility of subduction.  The gravitational body forces acting on old dense ocean lithosphere give rise to the second fundamentaldriving force  for the motion and deformation of the lithosphere, termed slab pull. The subduction process  leads to melting of both the subducting slab and theoverlying mantle wedge; the resultant melts  segregate to form magmatic arcs(island arcs when they are built on oceanic lithosphere and  {\em Andean} or {\emCordilleran} arcs when they are built on continental lithosphere).\section{Buoyancy of the ocean lithosphere} 	The condition required for the onsetof subduction  is the negative buoyancy of the ocean  lithosphere, i.e.:\begin{equation} \label{sub1} \frac{1}{z_{l}} \int_{0}^{z_{l}}\,\rho_{z}\, \geq\rho_{m}	  \end{equation} where $\rho_{z}$ is the density at depth $z$ within thelithosphere of thickness  $z_{l}$ and  $\rho_{z}$ is the density of  the convectivemantle.  Assuming an appropriate density structure for the ocean lithosphere we can solve for the critical  lithospheric thickness,  $z_{lc}$, for which Eqn\ref{sub1} is true.  We begin by assuming the  simplest of possible densitystructures in the ocean lithosphere, as shown in Figure \ref{ocdens}:\begin{eqnarray} \label{sub2} 			\rho_{z} = \rho_{c}			&		&	0 < z < z_{c}	\nonumber \\  		\rho_{z} = \rho_{m} \left(1Ê+Ê\alpha \,ÊT_{l}Ê\,\frac{z}{z_{l}}\right)Ê&		& z_{c} < z < z_{l}	  \end{eqnarray} where$\rho_{c}$ is the density of the crust.  The appropriate equality for $z_{lc}$ is:\begin{equation}	 \label{sub3} \frac{1}{z_{lc}}\, \int_{0}^{z_{lc}} \,\rho_{z}\,dz= \rho_{m}		 	 \end{equation} Integration of Eqn. \ref{sub3} gives:\begin{equation} 	\label{sub4}		  \frac{1}{z_{lc}}\left(\rho_{c} \,z_{c}Ê+ÊÊ\left(z_{lc}Ê-Êz_{c}\right) \left(\frac{Ê\rho_{m}\,\alphaÊ\,\left(T_{l}-T_{c}\right)}{2}\right)Ê\right) = \rho_{m} \end{equation} \begin{figure}[h,t,b]\includegraphics{Figures/Chapter_08/Figure_01.jpg}% \label{ocdens} \vspace{2.4in} \hspace{0.6in} %\special{epsf=:gdfigs:chap8:Fig8_1.eps  scale=0.70} \caption{\protect\scriptsize{Density structure assumed for solution of Eqn 8.1where $T_{c}$ is the temperature at the Moho.}} \end{figure}For a linear geotherm $T_{c}$ is given by: \begin{displaymath} \label{sub5} T_{c} =   T_{l} \left( \frac{ z_{c}}{z_{lc}} \right) \end{displaymath} An identicalsolution is readily obtained graphically by simply making the equivalence between the two regions in Figure \ref{ocdens}: \begin{equation} \label{sub6} z_{c} \,(\rho_{m} -\rho_{c})  =   \rho_{m}Ê\,Ê\alphaÊ\, T_{l}\frac{ \left(z_{lc}Ê-Êz_c\right)^2}{z_l \, 2} \end{equation} Substituting in the following values appropriateto the ocean lithosphere : $z_{c}$ = 6000 m, $\rho_{c} =  3000$ kg m$^{-3}$,$\rho_{m} = 3300$ kg m$^{-3}$,  $T_{m} - T_{s} = 1250^{o}$C, $\alpha = $ 3 x10$^{-5\, ^o}$K$^{-1}$, gives the critical  lithosphere thickness of 40 km. Substituting $z_{lc}$ into Eqn \ref{sub3} yields the critical age of 10 Ma,  forthe onset of negative buoyancy.  In this calculation we have assumed that  the only compositional changes associated with the production of oceanic lithosphere arewithin  the  oceanic crust due to the basalt extruded at the ridge axis.  However,the extraction of basalt  from the underlying peridotite must leave a depleted"harzbugitic" residual mantle peridotite, the  density of which is somewhat lessthan the primary mantle peridotite by an amount relating to  the proportion of meltextracted   (50 kg m$^{-3}$ for $25\% $ extraction). This "depleted" zone extends beneath the ridges to the base of melting (about 40 km for normal mantle with apotential  temperature of $1280^{o}C$, Figure \ref{amount}), and is eventuallyfrozen onto the base of the cooling  lithosphere.  Calculations which account forthis "depleted" nature of the upper 40 km of  oceanic mantle lithosphere show thatthe age for onset of negative buoyancy is significantly  greater than calculatedassuming the density structure as in Eqn \ref{sub2} and Figure \ref{ocdens}.  For example, Oxburgh \& Parmentier (1977) calculate a critical age of approximately 50Ma.	The above analysis shows that much of the old oceanic lithosphere will have the potential for initiating subduction, with the precise age dependent on the averagedensity of the  oceanic lithosphere.  Negatively buoyant lithosphere may however beheld up by the elastic strength of surrounding buoyant lithosphere, and the actual mechanism whichtriggers the onset  of subduction is poorly understood.  Moreover, youngerpositively buoyant oceanic lithosphere  may be subducted if it is dragged intopre-existing subduction zones by the pull of the older  subducting slab and thepush of the existing ridge.  Indeed, some workers have suggested it is possible that ocean ridges can  besubducted, even though they are necessarily positively buoyant. \section{Therml structure of subducted slabs}The penetration of the mantle by the subducting slab must disturb the thermal regime of the mantle, providing theslab does not heat up  by diffusion  at a rate fast compared to subduction. The question, then, is whether the advective or the diffusive termsin Eqn 4.3 dominatethe thermal evolution of the downgoing slab. Simple application of the dimensional analysis outined in section 4.2 allows us to resolve this problem by determining the thermal Peclet number appropriate to subduction (if $Pe_T$ $>$ 10 then  advection dominates weheras if $Pe_T$ $<$ 1  diffusion dominates). The thermal Peclet number   is given by : \[ Pe_T = \frac{v \, l}{\kappa} \] $v$ is given by  subduction velocities ( $>$ 1 cm/yr),  $l$ by the approrpiate  length-scale across which diffusion must act, which is here  defined by the thickness of thelithosphere (100 x 10$^3$ m) and $\kappa$ by the thermal diffusivity ($10^{-6}$ m$^2$ s$^{-1}$. The $Pe_T$ appropriate to subduction is therefore  about 30, thus implying that   subduction advects the thermal structure of the ocean lithosphere into the deep mantle.\section{The magnitude of slab  pull} 	Subduction occurs due to the gravitationalbody forces acting on the descending slab,  which are proportional to the densitycontrast between the slab and the surrounding hottermantle.  This density contrast,  which drives subduction, arises  because of (Figure 8.2):  \begin{itemize} \item thetemperature differences between the cool descending slab and the surrounding mantlewhich gives rise to a {\em thermal density defect} per unit length of slab of order 10$^{13}$ N m$^{-1}$, and \item density changes accompanying metamorphism of thedescending slab  such as eclogitizaton of the basaltic crust and shallowing of theolivine-spinel transition, which give rise to a {\em compositional density defect} also of order 10$^{13}$ N m$^{-1}$. \end{itemize} The forcebalance on the descending slab must also include a term related to the  viscousresistance of the mantle to the downward movement of the slab, which will be proportional to subduction velocity.  Because the rheological properties of rocksat high  temperatures are poorly known, this viscous term in the force balancecannot yet be quantified  to any reasonable levels of confidence.     An analyticalformulation of the slab pull is therefore far more complicated than for ridge push, and here we treat the problem in a qualitative way only. \begin{figure}[h,t,b] \label{kin0}% \vspace{4.0in} \hspace{0.7in}%\special{epsf=:gdfigs:chap8:Fig8_2.eps  scale=0.60}\caption{\protect\scriptsize{Schematic force balance on a subducting.} }  \end{figure}	That the upper parts of subducting slabs are in general descending under theinfluence of a gravitational body force is indicated by the existence of extensional stresses inthe descending  slab as witnessed by focal mechanisms of earthquakes generated in the upper 100 - 200 km of  the slab.  This implies that for most subductionenvironments the net gravitational body force  minus the viscous resistance (whichcombine to give slab pull) exceed the magnitude of the  ridge push) for normalvelocities of subduction (typically in the range 0 -10 cm yr$^{-1}$).  The lack  ofsubduction at rates significantly greater than 10 cm yr$^{-1}$ may be understood bythe increase  in the viscous resistence  for increased velocities: the viscousresistance providing a negative  feedback on the descent velocity. \section{Arc dynamics}\subsection*{Kinematics}From the point of view of lithospheric  kinematics, subduction represents one of two mechanisms accommodating convergence between plates;   the alternative mechanism being the internal deformation of  the plates.   The relative importance of subduction and internal deformation can be    illlstrated by considering the plate convergence velocity $V_{\rm con}$ relative    to subduction velocity $V_{\rm sub}$ as in Figures 8.3 \& 4.\includegraphics{Figures/Chapter_08/Figure_03.jpg} \begin{figure}[h,t,b] \label{kin1}% \vspace{2.0in}%\hspace{0in} \special{epsf=:gdfigs:chap8:Fig8_3.eps  scale=0.8}\caption{\protect\scriptsize{ Convergence between plates, $V_{\rm con} = V_2 -V_2$, may be taken up either by subduction $V_{\rm sub}$ or  by internal deformation of the plates as illustrated inFig. 8.4.}} \end{figure}\includegraphics{Figures/Chapter_08/Figure_04.jpg}\begin{figure}[h,t,b] \label{kin2} %\vspace{3.4in} \hspace{0.2in}%\special{epsf=:gdfigs:chap8:Fig8_4.eps  scale=0.55} \caption{\protect\scriptsize{Alternative kinematic scenariosfor convergent orogens expressed terms of the velocity of subduction relsative to velocity of plate convergence }} \end{figure}\subsection*{Mechanics}	While the subduction environment is one of convergence, it may not necessarily involvehorizontal compression. We have shown that the driving force for subduction isprovided by the negative buoyancy of old oceanic lithosphere which imparts tensional stressesin the  descending slab. The state of stress at the trench will depend primarily onthe buoyancy of the  oceanic lithosphere that is being subducted. We have alreadycommented that it is possible to  subduct relatively young buoyant lithosphere.Moreover, there are regions of elevated oceanic  lithosphere where the crust isanomalously thick due to, for instance, the accretion of Ocean  Island Basalts(OIB). Examples of subduction of anomalously bouyant oceanic lithosphere are provided by the Juan Fernandez and Nazca ridges presently being subducted beneaththe  amagmatic zones of the  South American Andes. Siesmicity from the slabdescending beneath  these regions shows that this anomalously buoyant oceaniclithosphere is subducting at a much  shallower angles than adjacent 'normal'oceanic lithosphere. The state of stress at the trench  may therefore becompressional if young or anomalously buoyant lithosphere is beingsubducted or it may be tensional if old negatively buoyant lithosphere is beingsubducted.	The force applied at the trench ($F_{t}$) provides a boundary condition fordeformation in the  neibouring arc, which is also subject to buoyancy  forces($F_{b}$) arising form the topographic  gradients on the arc itself (Chapter 3).The resultant force balance on an arc ($F_{a}$) can be  formulated as :\begin{equation} 					F_{a}  =  F_{t} - F_{b} \end{equation}  where $F_{t}$ and$F_{a}$ are positive  for compression and $F_b$ is the bouyancy force exerted by thearc  on the surrounding lithosphere.                                   Because of difficulties in formulating $F_t$ we do not provide a complete solutionhere (one way  of treating $F_{t}$ is in a completely ad hoc fashion by consideringit as variable within the bounds  of slab pull and ridge push). However,substantial horizontal extensional forces can arise from  topography of themagnitude observed in arcs. Extensional failureof an  arc gives rise to the development of small ocean basins, termed back-arcbasins, between  ruptured arc fragments. The foundering of old dense oceaniclithosphere in front of an active  arc will lead to a "roll back" effect of thetrench, which will greatly enhance the tendency of an  arc to spread (Figure8.4.). \section{Arcs and crustal growth} 	The magmatic island arcs and continentalmarginal arcs represent the most important  sub-aerial terrestrial volcanicprovinces.  In these settings the  visible volcanic activity is volumetrically minor in  comparison with contemporary intrusive activity.   Compositionallythe characteristic lavas of these terrains are andesitic (or quartz diorite,tonalite,  granodiorite or quartz monzonite intrusives), though basalts (gabbros)are also common.  These  zones of convergence between either continental - (e.g.the Andes) or oceanic lithosphere  (island arcs) and oceanic lithospheric plates,are sites which are probably critical to the  evolution of the continental crust(and subcrustal lithosphere).  The "andesite" model of Taylor  (1977) embodies thisconcept, suggesting that the average composition of at least the upper  continentalcrust is andesitic in bulk geochemical terms and that it aquired this composition because the main mode of continental growth has been by marginal accretion ofmagmatic arcs.	As we have seen in the previous chapters, the oceanic crust  has beendeveloped by  extensive and repeated fusion of the asthenosphereover a substantial portion of  the Earth's history (at least the past 2 Ga).  Thissource of MORB has very large-scale  depletions of lithophile (incompatible) trace-and minor elements in comparison with the pristine  or primitive (chondritic)mantle. The low $^{87}Sr/^{86}Sr$, $^{207}Pb/^{204}Pb$, $^{206}Pb/^{204}Pb$ andhigh  $^{143}Nd/^{144}Nd$ values of MORB imply that its source region has had low$Rb/Sr$, $Nd/Sm$ and  $U/Pb$ ratios for substantial periods of Earth history.  The fact that the continental  crust has complementary isotopic andgeochemical characteristics with those of MORB suggeststhat the crust represents the "missing-part" of this asthenospheric source of present-day  MORB.The question of what role arcs play in mediating this transition of ocenaic crust to continentalcrust is fundamental to understanding crustal growth.  \begin{figure}[h,t,b] \vspace{2.5in}\hspace{1in} \special{epsf=:gdfigs:chap8:Fig8_5.eps  scale=0.70}\caption{\protect\scriptsize{ A possible relationship between  MORB and continentalgrowth. 	If the important events which influence the complementary geochemical/isotopic  evolution of the sub-oceanic upper mantle and the continental crust doin deed take place at plate  boundaries (and there is some argument against this),then the critical boundary must be the  zones of lithospheric plate convergence(subduction zones).  It is clear that although the primary  extraction of materialfrom the asthenosphere takes place at the ridges the basalt produced here  does notresemble the continental crust , the upper portion of which is certainly much more felsic.  The following section will discuss how the quite special circumstancesthat exist in  subduction zones combine to produce and emplace relatively felsicmagmas in the crust , and  why these magmas probably contain a large part of theincompatible element content of the  oceanic crust (and hence of the sub-oceanicupper mantle).}} \end{figure}                                             \begin{figure}[h,t,b] \vspace{2.7in} \hspace{0.2in}\special{epsf=:gdfigs:chap8:Fig8_6.eps  scale=0.70} \caption{\protect\scriptsize{Nd and Sr isotopic composition of arc magmas and their potential sources.}}\end{figure}                                               \subsubsection{Thesources of arc magmas} 	One complicating factor in the study of arc magmatism isthe question of the source of  the magmas.  It is easy to show that the covariationof isotope and geochemical data for many  suites of arc volcanic rocks must be dueto mixing of components from more than one source and in fact many studies can demonstrate up to four or five seperate components. The possible  source components which may be available include: \begin{enumerate} \item The basaltic (crustal) portion of the subducting slab. 	\item The pelagic sediments which may be carried with the subducting slab. \item The depletedperidotite wedge above the subducting slab. \item The lower crust of the arcitself. \item An enriched (or none-depleted) mantle source (like the OIB source).\end{enumerate} 	Added to this list is the important fact that the oceanic crustundergoing subduction is  not pristine, but rather has undergone very extensivealteration, hydration and metamorphism   since the time of its formation at theridge. The upper portion of the subducting slab will  therefore undergo dehydration at depth generating fluids which themselves carry considerable  concentrations ofsolutes.  These will escape from the subduction zone and their role in fluxing  theoverlying mantle will have a pivotal role in the generation of arc magmas. 	 Thehydrothermal alteration is promoted by the initially high thermal gradient at the ridge crest which promotes circulation of sea water in fracture systems that mightextend  through the thickness of the whole crust.  The oceanic crust isgeochemically and  mineralogically modified by exchange with sea-water whichchanges (amongst other things) its  O- and Sr-isotopic composition towards those ofsea water.  The primary igneous minerals and  glass are altered to hydratesincluding talc, actinolite-tremolite , epidote ,chlorite, serpentine and  bruciteand these minerals carry their bound water to be released at depth from thesubducting  slab. \subsubsection{The thermal structure of arcs} 	The heat-flow along an across arctransect from the oceanwards-side of the trench to the  back-arc region variesconsiderably. There is low heat flow above the old oceanic crust,  extremely lowheat-flow from the trench and significantly higher flow from the arc and backarc regions.  The extremely low heat flow at the trenches is an expression of thepersistent coldness  of the the downgoing slab to depth.  This has the importanceof delaying the onset of those  dehydration reactions that are mainly temperaturedependent to much greater depths than under  the regime of normal geothermalgradients.  Particularly significant amongst these is the the  reaction (Figure\ref{stherm}):amphibole  $->$ Na - clinopyroxene (omphacite) + garnet + H$_{2}$O\noindent which defines the amphibolite - eclogite transition and at pressures lessthan 25-30 kbars. this  takes place at close to $1000^{o}$C. Above 25 kbars thereaction is much more pressure dependant  (Figure \ref{stherm}). \begin{figure}[t,h,b] \label{stherm} \vspace{2.9in} \hspace{0.6in}\special{epsf=:gdfigs:chap8:Fig8_7.eps  scale=0.70} \caption{\protect\scriptsize{The stability field of the hydrate amphibole as a function of temperature andpressure.} } \end{figure}  \begin{figure}[h,t,b] \label{stherm2} \vspace{2.4in}\hspace{0.5in} \special{epsf=:gdfigs:chap8:Fig8_8.eps  scale=0.60}\caption{\protect\scriptsize{ A simplified view of the thermal structure of thesubducting slab and the sub-arc mantle. The  stippled region illustrates thestability field of amphibole.  The break- down of amphibole  when the the slabreaches about 100 km releases H$_{2}$O and produces the dense  rock eclogiteconsisting of garnet and omphacite ($\rho = 3600$ kg m$^{-3}$). } } \end{figure}\subsubsection{Melting  in the Subducting Slab} 	The crustal part of the downgoingslab has the potential capacity to produce felsic melts with quite high lithophile element contents, high $^{87}$Sr/$^{86}$Sr,$^{207}$Pb/$^{204}$Pb, $^{206}$Pb/$^{204}$Pb and low  $^{143}$Nd/$^{144}$Nd.  Thisis partly due to the pelagic sediment component   and partly to the hydrothermalalteration of the basaltic oceanic crust.  A popular theory when  subduction wasfirst recognised was that arcs are dominated by intermediate (andesitic) magmas because they were derived from melting of mafic sources rather than the ultra-maficsources that  generate basaltic magmas, i.e. the upper part of the down-going slab. However, the common presence of basaltic magmas in arcs implies that the slab is not the major sourceof these melts .   Rather it seems more likely that the wedge of peridotite mantle above the slab is the source of  the bulk of the arc magmas and this melts atrelatively low temperatures because of the fluxing  by water -rich fluids drivenoff the slab.  The mantle wedge is also "enriched" with respect to  normal mantleperidotite in the lithophile (incompatible) element component derived from the slab.  The hydrous, mafic, primary magmas thus produced then undergo variablefractionation  en-route to the upper part of the crust to produce andesite, daciteand rhyolite.	The fate of the slab after it has suffered the extraction of small volumes ofmelts and  fluids is of interest.  Ringwood (1974) has determined the densityvariation of the main earth  materials in the subduction system.  As illustrated inFigure \ref{scomp}, the subduction zone can be  considered as a two layerd slabcomposed of MORB crust and depleted peridotite mantle  lithosphere (harzburgite)which is being thrust into asthenospheric mantle. Under conditions of  thermalequilibrium, at pressures equivalent to depths up to 650 km, MORB is more densethan  both asthenospheric and harzburgititic (lithospheric) peridotite, but is lessdense than both types  of peridotite in the depth interval 650- 720 km.  Depleted,harzburgitic peridotite is less  dense  than less refractory peridotite(asthenosphere) at all depths except in the 650 - 720 km interval.                                                               \begin{figure}[t,h,b] \label{scomp}\vspace{2.6in} \hspace{0.4in} \special{epsf=:gdfigs:chap8:Fig8_9.eps  scale=0.70}\caption{\protect\scriptsize{ Compositional structure of the descending slab.}}\end{figure} On this basis, Ringwood (1974) suggests that the subducting slab,reaches a neutral buoyancy  level at about 650 km where it is preserved as a layercomposed of harzburgite with remnant  blobs of the basaltic (MORB) portion of theslab.  He further suggests that this accumulated  layer would provide a physicalbarrier to promote the development and maintenance of a two - layered convectionsystem  in the mantle.\subsubsection{The role of water in arc magmatism} 	Allegre et al (1987) calculatethat over the past 4 Ga. subduction has recycled about 4  times the mass of thepresent oceans back into the mantle together with considerable amounts of  theatmospheric rare gas contents.  It is clear that the mantle residence time of thismassive flux  is essentially zero and that subduction zone volcanism is the obvioussite of outgassing of this  system.  The direct evidence for the role of water inarc magmatism comes from many observations.  These include: \begin{enumerate} \item Direct discharge of watervapour (with other fugitive species) during volcanic eruption,  leading to explosive and pyroclastic volcanism.  \item  High plagioclase content ofintermediate magmas resulting from its latent enrichment during  fractionation ofhydrous magmas. Water delaying the normal appearance of plagioclase to lower temperatures. \item  The expansion of olivine crystallisation to relatively silicicmagmas. \item  The occurence of hydrous minerals such as amphibole and biotite.\item  The discharge of magmatic hydrous fluids from decompressing andcrystallising magmas at  upper crustal pressures to contribute to hydrothermalalteration halos around some plutons(porphyry copper deposits). \item  The delayed, late, or none crystallisation ofquartz in many quatrz-normative magma systems.  \item  The complex oscilliatoryzonation/ resorbtion patterns of many phenocrysts in arc magmas  suggesting growthvariable $P_{H_{2}O}$ regimes in crustal magma chambers.  \item Vapor-bearing fluidinclusions in many phenocrysts. \end{enumerate}                                         \begin{figure}[t,h,b] \label{}\vspace{3.5in} \hspace{0.8in}\special{epsf=:gdfigs:chap8:Fig8_10.eps  scale=0.62} \caption{\protect\scriptsize{Peridotite solidi for dry, H$_{2}$O-undersaturated and H$_{2}$O -saturated (wet)conditions.  The stippled area  indicates the possible range of geothermalgradients.}} \end{figure} 	It is probable that melting in the peridotite wedgeabove the subducting slab takes place under conditions like those of the water undersaturated solidus in Figure \ref{}. Melting is  promoted by the high activity of water from the dehydration of the slaband the initiation of  melting will promote the rise of the geotherms in the stripof asthenosphere above the main   locus of dehydration in the slab.  This in turnwill contribute to the rise of the asthenosphere  beneath the arc, leading tothinning of the mantle lithosphere beneath arc and further  decompressive meltingin the asthenosphere.  At this stage the situation is not unlike that at the  midocean ridges and arc splitting and spreading may take place. The combination of theeffects  of the removal of the mantle lithosphere from beneath the arc and theaddition of large volumes   magmatic rocks to the crust will tend to depress thebase of the arc's crust through rising  geotherms, to the effect that the thesolidus of mafic rocks may be intersected at lower crustal  depths.  This will leadto short-timescale magmatic recycling within the arc itself.
