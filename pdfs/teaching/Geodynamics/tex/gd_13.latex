Such an interpretationsuggests very  efficient convection of this early stage may haveyielded new  crust at 200 times the present rate with  the attendantformation of the continental crust from the present MORB source regionby the end  of the Archaean bringing about its Rb/Sr, U/Pb and Nd/Smdepletion. A component of the OIB  source region has not out gassed orundergone significant melt extraction in the Earth's history.  This isthought to be a deeper part of the mantle and must either benon-convective, or be part   of a separate system unconnected withthat of the upper mantle.
