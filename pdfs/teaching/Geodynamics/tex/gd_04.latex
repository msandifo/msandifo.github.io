A number of idealized classes of constitutive relationsare recognized. The principal material behaviours are {\it elastic}, {\it plastic} and{\it viscous}. It should be noted that the constitutive relations appropriate to thesebehaviours are idealized and many materials show more complicated stress-strain relations.For example, a special class of behaviour of relevance to geology is {\itvisco-elasticity} (and visco-plasticity).\section{A rheological primer}In simple, isotropic, elastic materials stress and strain are linearly related. Animportant aspect of elasticity is that all strain is recovered on relaxation of thestress. Plastic material shows an elastic response up to a critical stress, termed theyield stress, at which the material fails. For perfectly plastic behaviour the materialcannot support stresses greater than the yield stress. In viscous materials stresses andstrain rates are related. Thus no deformation is recovered with the relaxation ofstresses. The general form of the constitutive relation  for  viscous materials is :\begin{equation} \label{eq:viscosity} \tau = k \, \dot{\gamma}^{\frac{1}{n}}  \end{equation} where $k$ and $n$ are constants, and $\dot{\gamma} $ is the shear strainrate. For $n$ = 1 the relationship between stress and strain rate is linear and thematerial is said to be Newtonian with the viscosity equal to $k$. Materials  with $n > 1$are termed {\it power-law} or {\it shear thinning} fluids. For high values of $n$ thebehaviour of the material may approximate plasticity in as much as a dramatic change inthe rate  of deformation occurs with the relatively small increases in shear stress. \begin{figure} \label{fig:step} \vspace{1.9in} \special{epsf=:gdfigs:chap3:Fig3_1.epsscale=0.800 } \caption{\protect\scriptsize{Elastic, viscous and  visco-elastic response toa step shear strain applied at time t=0.} }\end{figure}Visco-elastic materials show time dependent behaviour which is like elastic materials atshort time-scales and like viscous materials at longer time-scales as illustrated in theresponse to the application of a step-like  shear strain  in Figure \ref{fig:step} and  ina creep test in Figure  \ref{fig:creep}.\begin{figure} \label{fig:creep} \vspace{1.9in} \special{epsf=:gdfigs:chap3:Fig3_2.epsscale=0.800 } \caption{\protect\scriptsize{Elastic, viscous and  visco-elastic response toa creep test.}} \end{figure}\section{Background to lithospheric rheology}The distribution of seismicity in the ocean basins suggests that the ocean lithospheredeforms primarily by the rigid body translation  and rotation of large "plates"; as weshall see these motions are  sustained by the push of the ocean ridges and  the pull ofthe subducting slabs. The lack of internal deformation of the ocean lithosphere  reflectsits strength; it must be strong enough to sustain the stresses arising from these fundamental driving forces (that is, the ocean lithosphere acts as a stress guide).  Thebehaviour of the ocean  lithosphere contrasts with many parts of the continents whereinintense, diffuse, internal deformation is  manifested by the wide distribution of seismicevents. The  existence of diffuse deformation within the continental interiors impliesthat the continental lithosphere  is, in general, considerably weaker than the oceaniclithosphere (or that the magnitude of the stresses sustaining deformation of thecontinents is larger than for oceans). In addition, differences in the  behaviour of theoceanic and continental lithosphere are governed by differences in their  buoyancy. Oldoceanic lithosphere is negatively buoyant allowing eventual subduction and the effectiverecycling of the oceanic lithosphere in the convective mantle; one consequence is  thatthere is no oceanic lithosphere older than about 200 Ma on the surface of the modernEarth. In  contrast the continental lithosphere is always positively buoyant and cannot besubducted to any  significant extent; consequently we have fragments of the continentallithosphere dating back to about 3.9 Ga.In later chapters   we consider the deformation of the continental lithosphere in both compression (which results in the development of mountain belts) and in tension (whichresults  in the development of rifts and the attendant sedimentary basins and flankinguplifted margins).   We will not be so much concerned with the internal geometry ofdeformation (which is very  much the realm of structural geology) but the mechanical andthermal consequences of the deformation on the lithospheric scale.  Our aim is to develop an understanding of thecontrols  on some simple and regular, yet, as we shall see, fundamentally importantfeatures of  continental orogenic belts, for example, the {\em first-order} controls onelevation.  In order to understand the behaviour of the  continents during deformation webegin with some simple notions concerning the strength or  rheology  of the continentallithosphere. \begin{figure} \label{fig:rthree} \vspace{2.2in} \hspace{1.7in}\special{epsf=:gdfigs:chap3:Fig3_3.eps scale=0.600 } \caption{ \protect\scriptsize{ Thestress needed to deform the lithosphere and the failure mode depend upon the depth, thestrain  rate, the thermal structure as well as the mineralogical composition of thedeforming rocks. At   shallow depths (low confining pressures and low temperatures)failure occurs in the brittle mode, at  deeper levels (high confining pressures and hightemperatures) deformation occurs in a ductile  fashion. The strength of rocks is stronglydependent on the temperature and  the strain rate. Curve 1 is appropriate to low strainrates or high geotherms, while curve 2 is  appropriate to lower geotherms or higher strainrates. The brittle-ductile transition can be viewed as  the depth at which failure modeswitches, and coincides approximately with the base of the seismogenic zone. } } \end{figure}\section{A  model  lithosphere}The above discussion implies that the lithosphere has finite strength!  That is rocks areable to sustain a finite deviatoric stress (or  stress difference) by elastic deformation,all of which is recoverable on the relaxation of the  stress. At stress in excess of thecritical deviatoric stress rocks will undergo a permanent  deformation by processes suchas brittle fracture, dislocation creep, pressure solution, the  actual deformationmechanism depending on the temperature, strain rate and composition of the  rock.  Thefinite elastic strength of the lithosphere implies  the general rheological response  isplastic, and since the response of the lithosphere can be shown in many cases  to be timedependent \marginpar{{\scriptsize For example, in flexural basins}}the lithosphereexhibits a complex  form of visco-plasticity. The complete description of the rheologicalbehaviour of such a lithosphere represents a formidable challenge. However it is possibleto achieve the general form of a visco-plastic response by specifying a lithosphericrheology governed by a combination of two simple failure mechanisms, as described below.  \begin{figure} \label{fig:rfour} \vspace{2.2in} \hspace{0.7in}\special{epsf=:gdfigs:chap3:Fig3_4.eps scale=0.600 } \caption{\protect\scriptsize{Thestrength of the lithosphere is given by the area under the $\tau$ vs depth curves. Thestrength is a function primarily of the vertical  compositional structure of thelithosphere, the geotherm and the strain rate. (a) is appropriate to a low geotherm orhigh strain rate, i.e. strong lithosphere,  where the strongest part of the lithosphere isthe brittle upper mantle. (b) is appropriate to a  high geotherm or low strain rate (i.e.,a  weaker lithosphere) where there is no brittle mantle. Note  that the proportion of thetotal strength of the lithosphere concentrated in the crust (especially near  thebrittle-ductile transition) increases with increasing geotherm. }} \end{figure}Active seismicity in the continents is, by and large, restricted to depths less than about15 kms. Since seismic energy represents the release of elastic energy at failure along adiscrete fault plane, the lower limit of seismicity can be thought of as thebrittle-ductile transition.   The constitutive law describing failure in the brittle mode by a frictional sliding mechanism is frequently called Byrelee's law:  \begin{equation}	             \label{eq:friction1} 			\tau  = c_{o} + \mu\, \sigma_{n}  \end{equation} where$c_{o}$ is the cohesion, $\tau$ is the shear stress   required for failure ($\tau =\left(\sigma_1 - \sigma_3 \right)/2$), $\sigma_{n}$ is the normal stress on  the failureplane and $\mu$ is the coefficient of friction. Since the normal stress acting across the failure plane increases with depth the stress needed to cause brittle failure alsoincreases with  depth (as a linear function of depth for the case where the density isconstant with depth).The constitutive laws describing deformation in the ductile regime have a power-law form:\begin{equation} \label{eq:creep1} \frac{\left(\sigma_1 - \sigma_3 \right)}{G}  = \left(\frac{\dot\gamma}{A}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}} \: exp \left(\frac{\left(Q +P\,V^{*}\right)}{R\,T\,n}\right) \end{equation} where $G$ is the shear modulus (units ofPa), $A$ is a material constant with units s$^{-1}$, $\dot\gamma$ is the  shear strainrate, $Q$ is a material constant known as the activation energy of units J mol$^{-1}$,$V^{*}$ is the  activation volume in m$^{3}$ mol$^{-3}$, and $n$ is a dimensionlessmaterial constant known as the power law exponent.  The   exponential termin Eqn \ref{eq:creep1} expresses the inverse exponential dependence of strength on  temperature   which obeys an Arhenius relationship.  The PV* term is  usually small compared to Q andthus  Eqn \ref{eq:creep1} can be approximated by:  \begin{equation} \label{eq:creep2}\frac{\left(\sigma_1 - \sigma_3 \right)}{G}   =   \left(\frac{\dot\gamma}{A}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}} \:  exp\left(\frac{Q}{R\,T\,n}\right)					 \end{equation}Equations \ref{eq:creep1} and \ref{eq:creep2}  show that the strength of rocks to creepdecreases exponentially with  increasing temperature and increases with the strain rate.Thus for a given composition,  strength must decrease with depth.  In terms of this rheology the brittle-ductiletransition can therefore be understood as  the depth where the stress required for failureis equal for both ductile creep and brittle failure  (Figure \ref{fig:rthree}).                 The material constants for creep vary significantly with the mineralogical makeup of therock. For  example, quartz-rich rocks are much weaker than olivine-bearing rocks.  Thusthe strength of  the lithosphere can be determined only for a specific compositionalstructure (as well as thermal  structure).  To a first approximation we can consider thatthe continental lithosphere comprises  two layers: a quartz-rich crustal layer and anolivine-rich mantle layer. For any arbitrary  geotherm the strength of such a hypotheticallithosphere depends only on the material constants  appropriate to quartz and olivine(Figure \ref{fig:rfour}). Permanent deformation of the whole lithosphere  at given shear strainrate, $\dot\gamma$, will only occur when the force applied to the lithosphere exceeds the strength of the lithosphere, $F_l$, given by (Figure \ref{fig:rfive}b): \begin{equation}\label{eq:strength} F_l \, = \, \int_{0}^{z_{l}}Ê\left(\sigma_1 - \sigma_3 \right) \, dz \end{equation}For high strain rates, low geotherms or low applied forces much of the stress in thelithosphere  will be supported at least in part elastically (Figure \ref{fig:rfive}a).  Because of the dependence on strain  ratethe behaviour of the lithosphere is time dependent.  On short time scales the lithosphereis  able to support forces in an elastic fashion; on longer timescales it will relieve theapplied forces  by viscous, permanent deformation.  The rheology of the lithosphere maytherefore be  considered as visco-plastic.\begin{figure}[htb] \label{fig:rfive} \vspace{2.2in} \hspace{0.7in}\special{epsf=:gdfigs:chap3:Fig3_5.eps scale=0.600 } \caption{ \protect\scriptsize{ Thedistribution of stress within the lithosphere subject to a horizontal force (incompression or  tension) depends on the magnitude of the force, the strain rate and thegeotherm (for a given  composition). An  applied force, $F_{d}$, will give instantaneouslya homogeneous stress  distribution,  $\sigma_{i}$, throughout the lithosphere such that  $\sigma_{i}\,  z_{l} = F_{d}$  In those regions where $\sigma_{i}$ exceeds the criticalstress difference for permanent deformation the  stresses will be relaxed, with resultantamplification of the stress in the stronger parts of the  lithosphere. Permanentdeformation of the whole lithosphere can only occur when the whole  lithosphere fails (b),that is when the stress concentration everywhere exceeds the stress  difference requiredfor permanent deformation. For lower applied forces the stresses will be  supported atleast in part elastically (a).  }} \end{figure}                                                 \section{Uncertainties} The simple model for lithospheric rheology outlined in the previous section is highlyuncertain for a number of   reasons, and consequently must be used with some caution.Firstly, the lithosphere comprises polymineralic aggregates and the extent to which thewhole of the crust  can be described by {\em quartz-failure} and the mantle by {\emolivine-failure} is extremely dubious. The strength-depth curve for morerealistic compositional models of the lithosphere is likely to be much more complex than shown in models shown in Figs\ref{fig:rfour}  \& \ref{fig:rfive}.  Secondly, the material constants are determined inlaboratory experiments carried out at strain rates appropriate to human activity($10^{-5}$--$10^{-8} {\rm s}^{-1}$), as opposed to geological strain rates($10^{-13}$--$10^{-16} {\rm s}^{-1}$). This is particularly important because only small changes in the value of the material constants have a large effect on the calculatedstrength. Finally, the model excludes a number of deformation mechanisms, such as pressuresolution which are known to be operative at least under some conditions.Such uncertainties render futile the calculation of the absolute strength of thelithosphere using this simplistic model. For example, a 10\% uncertainty in the activationenergy for creep corresponds to an uncertainty in the strength of the lithosphere of abouta factor of 2. However,  much more significance can be attached to estimates of thechanges in strength   accompanying changes in the physical state of the lithosphere usingthis model, because at least in this case uncertainties in the material constants cancel.For example,  a change  in the thermal regime of the lithosphere  corresponding to achange in the Moho temperature of  100$^{\rm o}$C causes a change in the strength of abouta factor of 2 (Fig. \ref{rsix}). \begin{figure}[htb] \label{rsix} \vspace{3.2in} \hspace{0.7in}\special{epsf=:gdfigs:chap3:Fig3_6.eps scale=0.600 } \caption{\protect\scriptsize{Illustration of the dependence of lithospheric strength calculated using our simplerheological model on thermal state of the lithosphere, as reflected by the Mohotemperature.  }} \end{figure}
