Remembering that force equalsstress by area we begin by decomposing thesurfaces forces into stresses acting on each of the faces. \begin{figure}\label{balance}\vspace{1.9in}\hspace{1.7in}\special{epsf=:gdfigs:chap2:Fig2_5.eps scale=0.700 }\caption{\protect\scriptsize{Co-ordinate system used to derive the equations of motion}}\end{figure}Assume that at the point, P, centred within the parallelpiped the  normal stresses in the directions $x$, $y$ and$z$ are given by $\sigma_{xx}$, $\sigma_{yy}$ and $\sigma_{zz}$. The shear stress in thedirection normal to $x$ and parallel to $y$ is given by $\tau_{xy}$ and parallel to $z$by $\tau_{xz}$. Similarly the shear stresses  normal to $y$ are given  by$\tau_{yx}$ and  $\tau_{yz}$, and  normal to $z$ by $\tau_{zx}$ and $\tau_{zy}$. Then the forces acting in the direction $x$ on the faces BB'CC'and  AA'DD' are, respectively: \[\left\{ \sigma_{xx} + \frac{1}{2} \frac{\partial{\sigma_{xx} }} {\partial{x}} \delta_{x}\right\} \delta_{y} \delta_{z} \] and\begin{equation}-\left\{ \sigma_{xx} - \frac{1}{2} \frac{\partial{\sigma_{xx} }} {\partial{x}} \delta_{x}\right\} \delta_{y} \delta_{z}  \end{equation}where the negative sign  is due the fact that stresses are treated as positivein tension and negative in compression.Across the faces A'B'C'D' and ABCD the forces are \[\left\{ \tau_{xy} + \frac{1}{2} \frac{\partial{\tau_{yx} }} {\partial{y}} \delta_{y}\right\} \delta_{x} \delta_{z} \]and\begin{equation}-\left\{ \tau_{xy} - \frac{1}{2} \frac{\partial{\tau_{yx} }} {\partial{y}} \delta_{y}\right\} \delta_{x} \delta_{z} \end{equation}Across the faces DCC'D' and ABB'A' the forces are \[\left\{ \tau_{xz} + \frac{1}{2} \frac{\partial{\tau_{zx} }} {\partial{z}} \delta_{z}\right\} \delta_{x} \delta_{y} \] and\begin{equation}-\left\{ \tau_{yz} - \frac{1}{2} \frac{\partial{\tau_{zx} }} {\partial{z}} \delta_{z}\right\} \delta_{x} \delta_{y}  \end{equation}The body force acting on the volume with density, $\rho$, in the direction $x$ isgiven by\begin{equation}\rho X \delta_x \delta_y \delta_z\end{equation}The total force in the $x$ direction is then \begin{equation}\left\{ \frac{\partial{\sigma_{xx}}} {\partial{x}} + \frac{\partial{\tau_{yx}}} {\partial{y}} +\frac{\partial{\tau_{zx}}} {\partial{z}} + \rho X \right\}\delta_x \delta_y\delta_z\end{equation}If the component of displacement of point P in the $x$ direction is $u$ then Newton's second law gives \begin{equation}\rho \frac{\partial{^2u}}{\partial{^2t}} =  \frac{\partial{\sigma_{xx}}}{\partial{x}} +  \frac{\partial{\tau_{yx}}} {\partial{y}} +\frac{\partial{\tau_{zx}}} {\partial{z}} + \rho X \end{equation}Similar results obtain for the $y$ and $z$ directions. In tectonic settingsaccelerations can be regarded as neglible, and the only body force is gravity whichacts in the vertical direction, taken to be $z$,  and using the convention forsummation over repeated indices, the equations of motion can be reduced to:\begin{equation}\label{eq:motion}  0 =  \frac{\partial{\tau_{i,j}}} {\partial{x_i}} + a_{i} \rho g \end{equation}where $a_i$ is the unit vector $\left(0,0,1\right)$. Note that in the convention for indices adoptedin Eqn \ref{eq:motion} the co-ordinates $x$, $y$ and $z$ are given by $x_1$,  $x_2$ and  $x_3$,respectively,  while $\sigma_{ii} = \tau_{ii}$. Equation \ref{eq:motion} is general and can be appliedto many problems related to tectonic phenomona. However, since it is couched in terms of thecomponents of the stress tensor it must be rendered  useful through  combination with  {\it constitutive equations}relating stresses to displacements.%\section{Non-dimensionalising  the heat equation}  \section{Calculation of ridge-push force}  Inorder to solve Eqn. \ref{eq:ridgef} we need to formulate the density distributionappropriate to Figure \ref{ocean}a.  The appropriate density distribution is (Figure \ref{ocean}b):\begin{eqnarray}		\rho_{z}	 = \rho_{m},& 			t  = 0, &	0 < z  \nonumber \\	\rho_{z}	 =  \rho_{w},	&		t  = t_{1}, &	0 < z < w  \nonumber \\		\rho_{z}	 =  \rho_{m}\left[1 + \alpha\, \left(T_{m} - T_{z}\right)\right], &t  = t_{1}, & w < z < w + z_{l}        \end{eqnarray}where $\rho_{m}$ is the density of mantle at $T_{m}$, the temperature of theasthenosphere, $\rho_{w}$ is the  density of water, $\alpha$ is thevolumetric coefficient of thermal expansion of peridotite. The densitydistributions defined by Eqn \ref{eq:ridgef} give the following variation$\left(\sigma_{zz}\right)_{z}$: \begin{eqnarray}		\left(\sigma_{zz}\right)_{z} = \rho_{m}\, g\, z	  ,& 			t  = 0, &	0 < z \nonumber \\\left(\sigma_{zz}\right)_{z} = \rho_{w}\, g\, z ,	&		t  = t_{1}, &	0 < z < w \nonumber \\	\left(\sigma_{zz}\right)_{z} = \rho_{w}\, g \,w  +  g\, \int_{w}^{w+z_{l}}\rho_{z} dz ,  &t  = t_{1}, & w < z < w + z_{l}        \end{eqnarray}$F_{1}$ and $F_{2}$ are given by:\begin{equation} F_{1}   =  \int_{0}^{w+z_l}\left(\sigma_{zz}\right)_{z} \, dz 			        =   \frac{\rho_{m}\,Êg\,Ê\left(wÊ+Êz_{l}\right)^{2}}{2}		\end{equation} \begin{equation} F_{2}  = \int_{0}^{w}\left(\sigma_{zz}\right)_{z} \, dz 			         =   \frac{\rho_{w}\,Êg\,Êw^{2}}{2}		\end{equation} Since in the lithosphere   the density  is  itself a function of depth the third term, $F_{3}$, inEqn \ref{eq:ridgef} is given by: \begin{equation} 		    		    F_{3}  = \int_{w}^{w+z_{l}}\left(\sigma_{zz}\right)_{z} \, dz \\\end{equation} Assuming that the lithospheric geotherm at $t_{1}$ is linear in depth, thetemperature at the surface of  the lithosphere $T_{s} = 0^{o}$C, and $\alpha$ isindependent of temperature then: \begin{displaymath} 	T_{z}  = T_{m}\, \frac{ z}{z_{l}} ,    \;   \rho_{z}  =\rho_{m} \left(1Ê+Ê\alpha\,ÊT_{m}Ê\left(1-Ê\frac{z}{z_{l}}\right)\right)  \end{displaymath} then \begin{displaymath} 	g\, \int_{w}^{w+z_{l}}Ê\rho_{z} \,dz   =   g\, z_{l}\, \rho_{m}  +  \frac{gÊ\,z_{l}Ê\,\rho_{m}\,Ê\alphaÊ\,T_{m}}{2}  =  g \,z_{l} \,\rho_{m} \left(1Ê+Ê\frac{\alpha \,ÊT_{m}}{2}	\right)		\end{displaymath}and\begin{equation}F_{3}  =  \rho_{w} \,g\, w\, z_{l}   +   \frac{g\,Êz_{l}^{2}\,Ê\rho_{m}}{2} \left(1Ê+ÊÊ\frac{\alphaÊ\,T_{m}}{2}  \right)  \end{equation}Thus Eqn \ref{eq:ridgef} is given by\begin{equation} F_{R}  =   \frac{\rho_{m}\,Êg\,Ê\left(wÊ+Êz_{l}\right)^{2}}{2}    -  \frac{\rho_{w}\,ÊgÊ\,w^{2}}{2}   - 			\left(\rho_{w}\,Êg\,Êw\,Êz_{l}ÊÊ+ÊÊ\frac{gÊ\,z_{l}^{2}\,Ê\rho_{m}}{2}\left(1Ê+ÊÊ\frac{\alpha \,ÊT_{m}}{2}\right)\right)	 \end{equation}The condition of isostatic compensation at depth, $w\, + \,z_{l}$, requires that\begin{displaymath} \sigma_{zz \, \left(z = w + z_{l},\, t = 0\right)} = \sigma_{zz \, \left(z = w +z_{l}, \, t = 1\right)} \end{displaymath}			Solving for $z_{l}$ gives:			 \begin{displaymath} z_{l}   =  \frac{wÊ\left(\rho_{m}-\rho_{w}\right)}{\alpha \,Ê\rho_{m}\,ÊT_{m}	}\end{displaymath}
