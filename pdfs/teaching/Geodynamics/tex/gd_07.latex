The volcanic rocks extruded atthe surface of the ridges are  exclusively basalt (mid-ocean ridge basalt or MORB)which, together with there sub-volcanic  intrusive equivalents - gabbros and sheeteddykes, comprise the entire oceanic crust. The total  thickness of the oceanic crustgenerated by mafic igneous activity at the ridges is typically about 5-7 km.  The structure of oceanic crust and parts of the subcrustal lithosphere can be directlyobserved in  some ancient orogenic belts where fragments of the oceanic lithosphere have beenobducted to  form {\em ophiolites} during collision processes, for example the Semailophiolite in Oman.\begin{figure}[h,t,b]\label{oceanlith}\vspace{1.5in}\hspace{0.3in}\special{epsf=:gdfigs:chap7:Fig7_1.eps  scale=0.77}\caption{\protect\scriptsize{Schematic structure of the ocean lithosphere. The ocean lithosphereconsists of about 6-7 km thick  crust  (heavy stiple), and the mantle lithosphere(intermediate stiple) which thickens with age (and  hence distance away from the ridge asindicated by arrows). Light stiple show the region of  decompression melting beneath theridge. Stream lines in the asthenosphere may be largely  decoupled from the motion of theoverlying lithosphere (see Section 5.5), although asthenosphere  must undergodecompression immediately beneath the ridge.}} \end{figure}\section{Age, bathymetry and heatflow}	In ocean lithosphere younger than about 80 Ma there is a remarkable correspondence between age of the ocean crust, the depth to the sea floor (bathymetry) and the heat flow through the lithosphere (Fig. \ref{oceanlith}); with bathymetric depth increasing, andsurface heatflow decreasing,  with the $\sqrt{Êage}$. This correspondence between age,bathymetry and heatflow is due to time  dependent changes in the thickness of thelithosphere. Two models for the ocean lithosphere  have been proposed in order to accountfor this relation: the {\it half-space model} and the {\it thermal  plate model}.\subsubsection{The half-space model}	 The cooling of ocean lithosphere after formation at a ridge can be treated as a thermal conduction problem (see Chapter 3) in which a non-steady state condition (the situationat the  ridge) gradually decays towards a thermally equilibrated state (as the oceanlithOSphere slides  away from the ridge). The analogy  (Fig \ref{half}a) can be madewith the cooling of a semi-infinite  half space, which is given by:\begin{equation}\label{eq:halfs}\frac{T_{z}Ê-ÊT_{m}}{ T_{s}Ê-ÊT_{m}} = erfc\left(\frac{z}{2\,\sqrt{\kappa\, t}}\right)\end{equation}where $T_{z}$ is the temperature at depth $z$, $T_{s}$ is thetemperature at the surface interface of the semi-infinite half space (which in this caseis the temperature of ocean water and is taken to be $0^{o}$C), $T_{m}$ is thetemperature of  the half space in the initial condition and which ismaintained at infinite distance for all time (in   our case the temperatureof the deep mantle, {$1280^{o}$C}), {$\kappa$} is the thermal diffusivityand {$t$}  is time (the error function, {$erf$}, and its compliment, {$erfc$},arise commonly in analytical solutions to the  heat equation and related differential equations whichemploy similarity variables).	The behaviour of the error function, and hence Eqn \ref{eq:halfs}, is illustrated inFigure \ref{half}b. As {$z$  tends to $\infty$ or {$t$} to 0 then: \begin{displaymath}  erfc  \left(\frac{z}{2\,\sqrt{\kappa\, t}} \right)		 \rightarrow  0 \end{displaymath}and {$T_{z}$} approaches {$T_{m}$}. As {$z$} tends to 0 or {$t$} to $\infty$ then   \begin{displaymath}erfc\left(\frac{z}{2\,\sqrt{\kappa \, t}} \right)		 \rightarrow  1 \end{displaymath}and {$T_{z}$} approaches {$T_{s}$}, providing\begin{displaymath}\left(\frac{z}{2\,\sqrt{\kappa \,t}} \right)	 < 2	 \end{displaymath}                                                                 \begin{figure}[h,t,b]\label{half}\vspace{2.00in}\special{epsf=:gdfigs:chap7:Fig7_2.eps  scale=0.65}\caption{\protect\scriptsize{Schematic thermal structure of the ocean lithosphere treated as a problem of the coolingof a semi-infinite half space.

Following Turcotte and Schubert (1982, p. 164-165, p. 181-182)  the thickness of the lithosphere, $z_{l}$, as afunction of age, $t$, is given by: \begin{equation}\label{eq:lith}z_{l}  =  2.32\, \sqrt{Ê\kappaÊ\,t}Ê					\end{equation}The depth of the ocean floor beneath the ridge crest, $w$, at time, $t$, after formation is given by:\begin{equation}\label{eq:water}w  =  \frac{2Ê\,\rho_{m}\,Ê\alpha \,ÊT_{m}}{\rho_{m}Ê-Ê\rho_{w}}\sqrt{Ê\frac{\kappaÊ\,t}{Ê\pi}}		 \end{equation}where $\alpha$ is the thermal coefficient of expansion and $\rho_{m}$ and $Ê\rho_{w}$are the density of mantle and water, respectively. The surface heat flow, $q_{s}$,  attime, $t$, after formation is given by:\begin{equation}\label{eq:heatf}q_{s}  =  k\,T_{m}\, \frac{ 1}{\sqrt{\pi \,\kappaÊ\,t}}	\end{equation}where $k$ in the thermal conductivity.	Some interesting consequences arise from the behaviour described by these equations. For example, Equation \ref{eq:water} shows that the average depth of the ocean is proportional to its crustal age.  Given a constant volume of sea water, a change in the average age and hence depth of the oceans must result in a change in  sea level, which is reflected in the geological record by the extent  of ocean onlap on the continents. The average age of the oceans is inversely proportional to the rate of sea floor spreading, and directly proportional to the square root of the mean age of subduction.  The mean depth of the oceans, $\omega$, as a function of the averageage of subduction,  $t$, is given by\begin{equation}\label{eq:depth}\omega  =   \frac{1}{\tau}\,\int_{0}^{\tau}\, wÊ \,dt				\end{equation}substituting for $w$ in Eqn 2.2 gives:\begin{equation}\label{eq:depth2}	 \omega  =  \frac{4\,\rho_{m} \, \alpha_{\upsilon}\,ÊT_{m}}{3Ê\,\left(\rho_{m}-\rho_{w}\right)}\sqrt{\frac{\kappa\, \tau}{\pi}} \end{equation} Secular variations inthe rate of sea floor spreading, reflected in the mean age of subduction  maytherefore have important implications to the average height  of the oceans.Indeed, this  explanation has been used to account for high ocean standsduring the Cretaceous (when sea  level may have been up to 300 m higher thantoday) which correspond with periods of fast  ocean floor spreading (asindicated by analysis of ocean floor magnetic anomalies).  \subsubsection{The thermal plate model}	The semi-inifinite half space model predicts continuous cooling (albeit at a rate that gradually decays with time) and therefore thickening of the lithosphere through time(Figure \ref{model}).  While the predictions are in remarkable agreement with the observations onbathymetry and heat  flow in young ocean lithosphere these relationships appear to break down inocean lithosphere  older than about 80 Ma, when the thermal structure of the oceanic lithosphereappears to be  stabilised.                                                               \begin{figure}[h,t,b]\label{model}\vspace{1.9in}\special{epsf=:gdfigs:chap7:Fig7_3.eps  scale=0.68}\caption{\protect\scriptsize{Thermal structure of the ocean lithosphere predicted by thesemi-infinite half space model (a) and by the thermal plate model (b).}}\end{figure}	The semi-infinite half space model assumes that the half space is not convecting. In the earth the deep mantle is convecting, with the consequence that a convective heat flux is provided at the top of the convecting layer (see Chapter 7).  The thermal plate model accounts for this apparent time independent behaviour of old oceanic lithosphere by  assuming that the convection in the subjacent mantle provides sufficient heat to the base of the cooling lithosphere to stabilise the cooling once a critical thickness is reached, the observations suggest this critical thickness is about 125 km corresponding to the thickness of ~80 Ma old lithosphere (Figure \ref{model}b). Simply stated, the oceanic plate structure is thermally stabilised when the convectiveheat  supply to the base of the lithosphere balances heat lost through the lithosphere.\section{Force balance on the ocean ridge}	For young ocean lithosphere the cooling of a semi infinite half space provides an acceptable approximation and therefore Eqns \ref{eq:halfs} - \ref{eq:water} can be used as the basisto calculate the  force balance on the ocean ridge. The isostatic compensation of the oceaniclithosphere causes  the youngest ocean to form a high, albeit submerged, mountain range standing outabove the  abyssal plains. Such profound topographic gradients necessarily lead to substantialhorizontal  buoyancy forces (Chapter 2), termed the ridge push. In this section we provide the methodology for calculating the magnitude of the ridge push.\begin{figure}[h,t,b,p]\label{ocean}\vspace{3.7in}\hspace{0.7in}\special{epsf=:gdfigs:chap7:Fig7_4.eps  scale=0.85}\caption{\protect\scriptsize{Ridge push is the force resultingfrom isostatically induced  topographic gradients in the oceanic lithosphere.(a) shows a diagramatic representation  of the force balance betweena ridge and ocean lithosphere at age $t = t_{1}$. (b) shows the  densitydistribution appropriate to (a). The dashed line shows the verticaldensity structure  at $t = 0$. The solid line shows the vertical densitystructure at $t = t_{1}$. (c) shows the  graphical solution to the force balance.}}\end{figure}	Refering to Figure \ref{ocean}a the ridge push, $F_{R}$, operating on the oceaniclithosphere of  age, $t_{1}$, and depth below the ridge crest, $w$, is givenby: \begin{equation}\label{eq:ridgef}F_{R}  =  F_{1} - F_{2} - F_{3}	\end{equation}which is equivalent to solving Eqn 2.3, as shown diagramatically in Figure \ref{ocean}c.Note that $F_1$ corresponds to the outward push of the asthenosphere beneath themid-ocean ridge while $F_2$ and $F_3$ correspond, respectively,  to the  push of thewater column and the old ocean lithosphere inward against the ridge.\begin{figure}[h,t,b]\label{push}\vspace{1.9in}\hspace{0.5in}\special{epsf=:gdfigs:chap6:Fig6_5.eps  scale=0.55}\caption{\protect\scriptsize{Ridge push, $F_{R}$, plotted as function of depth of ocean beneath ridge crest,$w$.}}\end{figure}The quantitative evaluation of  Eqn \ref{eq:ridgef} is given in the Appendix A.3. Thesolution of Eqn \ref{eq:ridgef} for any depth, $w$, below the ridge crest is shown inFigure \ref{push}, assuming  the following physical properties $\alpha = 5$ x $10^{-5}$,$\rho_{m} = 3300$ kg m$^{-3}$, $\rho_{w} = 1000$ kg m$^{-3}$, $T_{m} =  1250^{o}$C and $g= 10$ m s$^{-2} $.\begin{figure}[h,t,b]\label{geotherm}\vspace{3.0in}\hspace{1in}\special{epsf=:gdfigs:chap7:Fig7_6.eps  scale=0.65}\caption{\protect\scriptsize{The oceanic lithosphere is characterised by its conductive geothermalgradient.

Note that with the lithosphere of normalthickness (125 km), the solidus of the  mantle peridotite nowhere intersects thegeotherm but that on rifting of the lithosphere, the  decompressedasthenosphere's adiabat intersects the solidus at about 40 km depth. }} \end{figure}                                                          \section{Formation of the oceanic crust}	The ridge push resulting from the topography of the ocean floor, and the density structure within the oceanic lithosphere, provides (along with slab pull) one of the primary driving forces for lithospheric motion. The ridge push effectively maintains the constant rupturing of the oceanic lithosphere, and its separation on either side of the ridges. An important result of this rupture of the lithosphere at the ridges relates to the decompression of the underlying asthenosphere.                                           \begin{figure}[h,t,b]\label{melt}\vspace{2.6in}\hspace{0.3in}\special{epsf=:gdfigs:chap7:Fig7_7.eps  scale=0.63}\caption{\protect\scriptsize{P-T diagram showing melting field of garnet peridotite and adiabatic (isentropic) decompression paths for mantle with potential temperatures of $1280^{o}C$, $1380^{o}C$,$1480^{o}C$ and $1580^{o}C$, respectively  (after McKenzie and Bickle, 1988).}}\end{figure}	The decompression of asthenosphere beneath spreading ridges is so rapid that there is virtually no loss of heat per unit rock mass; the decompression is therefore isentropic. Since small volume increases occur during isentropic decompression there is necessarily a small decrease in the the heat content per unit volume, and hence temperature. The change in temperature with pressure at constant entropy defines the adiabat. The entropy, $S$, volume, $V$, pressure and temperature of a system are related by the Clausius - Clapeyron equation: \begin{equation}\label{eq:clas}\frac{\Delta P}{\Delta T}  =  \frac{\Delta S}{\Delta V}  					 \end{equation}During isentropic (adiabatic) decompression, the decrease in pressure isaccompanied by only small volume increases and thus T must decrease. This adiabaticgradient is about $1^{o}$C/km in the solid  mantle. If  the system becomes partlymolten, then the change in volume with  pressure is larger  and T changes more quickly.Since the temperature of the convective mantle is not constant  but lies on an adiabatwe characterise it by its potential temperature  ($T_{m}$), which is the   projected ofthe adiabat to the surface of the earth (i.e., at 1 atm).	If sufficient decompression occurs,  melting of the asthenosphere will take place when theadiabat passes throughits  solidus (Figure \ref{melt} and \ref{amount}). The melt generated by this decompression hasthe composition of  MORB and provides the parental liquid for all igneous rocksthat make up the oceaniccrust.                                                                                                  	The amount of melting generated due to decompression of asthenospheric mantle beneath an active ridge segment depends entirely on the thermal structure of the asthenosphere and the melting properties of the mantle as a function of pressure. For the present day thermal structure ($T_{m} = 1280^{o}$C) the amount of melting during complete decompression,  amounts to avertical column some 7  km  thick (Figure \ref{amount}). In the past, when the internaltemperature may have been considerably  hotter than it is today, the column ofmelt generated beneath the ridges, and hence the oceanic  crust, may have beensignificantly thicker than 7 km.\begin{figure}[h,t,b]\label{amount}\vspace{2.6in}\hspace{0.3in}\special{epsf=:gdfigs:chap7:Fig7_8.eps  scale=0.63} \caption{\protect\scriptsize{Thickness of melt (measured as a vertical column in kms) present below the given indicated depth produced by the adiabatic decompression of garnet peridotite for different potential temperatures (after McKenzie and Bickle, 1988).

Adiabaticdecompression of the modern day  mantle by the complete removal of the overlyinglithospheric "lid" (for example at a spreading  ridge) will result in thegeneration of a 7 km pile of MORB-like melt  (i.e., the oceanic crust). }}\end{figure}\section{Coupling of the -spheres?}	Equation \ref{eq:water}, derived entirely from theoretical considerations, is in excellent agreement with observed bathymetry of ocean lithosphere younger than about 80 Ma. Indeed, this remarkable agreement between observations and the age-heatflow-bathymetry relationships predicted by Eqns \ref{eq:halfs} - \ref{eq:water} provides one of the principal lynchpins of the plate tectonicparadigm and one of  the most persuasive lines of argument that the lithosphere is indeed thermallystabilised. Morover, it suggests that the motion of the oceaniclithosphere is largely decoupled  from the flow in the underlying asthenosphere. Thereis as yet no clear understanding of the  location, or even the general  planform ofmantle upwelling in the asthenosphere. Most  importantly, we have shown that there isno requirement that the ocean ridges represent the site  of upwelling (Figure\ref{oceanlith}). Wherever asthenospheric upwelling occurs it is likely to modify the thermal structure of the overlying lithosphere, and the suggestionis that the  thermal structure of most old oceanic lithosphere has been modified tosome degree by  upwelling  from within the underlying mantle.\section{Oceanic basalt chemistry}	The oceanic lithosphere is generated entirely by magmatic processes, most of these concentrated at the mid ocean ridges, but with small, but scientifically interesting additions at intraplate hot spots forming the ocean island and sea mount chains (eg Hawaii, the Azores, Reunion, Iceland etc). Seafloor spreading generates about  20 km$^{3}$a$^{-1}$ ofMid Ocean Ridge  Basalt (MORB) by the decompressional fusion mechanism describedabove (Figures \ref{geotherm}-\ref{amount}),  making these by far the most important volcanicprovinces on Earth. From the perspective of  this course we are most interested to knowwhat  oceanic magmatism tells us about the  chemistry and "ages" of their mantlesource regions.	With respect to important trace element concentrations and the abundance of radiogenic isotopes, the basaltic rocks of the ocean islands (OIB) differ quite significantly from MORB. As oceanic magmatism must be sampling the sub-lithospheric mantle this immediately indicates that there are chemically distinct regions of the oceanic asthenosphere and the differences in Nd, Sr and Pb isotopic compositions (see Figure \ref{oiso}) are such that  theseseparate regions must  have remained isolated for timescales of the order of 2Ga or more. This in turn places limits on  the type of mantle dynamics andconvection  that must have occured.  	As discussed in the previous chapter, MORB has the Sr, Nd (and Pb)isotopic  characteristics, as well as incompatible trace element chemistry,consistent  with  derivation  from a source which underwent the extractionof significant fractions of melt at some period in the past. Broadly speakingthe extent of depletion of Rb, U and Nd in the oceanic upper  asthenosphereas reflected by present-day MORB is consistent  with being the compliment of  thecontinental crust. Clearly, continental crust is not  being produced at thepresent mid oceanic  ridges and for the lithophile elements to find their wayfrom the sub-oceanic mantle to the  continents we must invoke at least  atwo-stage process. This second stage process may  involve subduction and arc formation.Alternatively, it is possible that the main continental growth occurred in the Precambrian and was unrelated to the Earth's present geodynamic mode.\begin{figure}[h,t,b]\label{oiso}\vspace{3.0in}\hspace{0.7in}\special{epsf=:gdfigs:chap7:Fig7_9.eps  scale=0.62} \caption{\protect\scriptsize{The range of radiogenic isotopic compositions (Nd, Sr, Pb and He) ofoceanic basalts. The stippled  area is the compositional range of Mid Ocean RidgeBasalts (MORB). The remaining envelope is  the region of ocean island basalts(OIB). Clearly the OIB sources of the whole Earth are not all the  same (fromAllegre, 1987)}} \end{figure}\subsubsection{Rare Gas Studies}	The atmophile inert gases, particularly He, Ar and Xe have recentlyprovided substantial  evidence for the existence, nature and life-span ofimportant terrestrial reservoirs. These  elements are of course stronglyconcentrated in the Earth's atmosphere. Perhaps surprisingly   however, recent carefulmeasurements of gasses emmitted during volcanic eruptions, included  in freshvolcanic rocks (glasses) and even produced from hot springs and wells incontinental  and oceanic regions, reveal that detectible amounts of these andother gasses are still  being  released from the earth's interior. Furthermorethese often show significant isotopic differences  from the atmosphericreservoir indicating that emissions are tapping source regions which have  beenisolated for significant portions of the Earth's history. $^{40}$Ar  is the radiogenic product of the decay of  $^{40}$K and $^{36}$Ar is astable isotope. $^{4}$He is  the product  of various decay series of U and Th  and$^{3}$He is a stable isotope. The atmosphere  has extremely high ratios of  $^{4}$He/$^{3}$He (722,000) and $^{40}$Ar/$^{36}$Ar (295) because it is dominated by the accumulation of these products of radioactive decay of lithophileelements.	MORB has high $^{4}$He/$^{3}$He ratios, though values are lower than those of theatmosphere,  and  extremely high $^{40}$Ar/$^{36}$Ar. This is interpreted toindicate that the  source region of MORB  was effectively purged of most of its rare gas content early in the earth's  history and that most of the He  and in particular, the Ar there now is derived fromsubsequent  U-Th  and K decay. The existence of significant $^{3}$He doeshowever indicate that  the early   degassing of the earth's interior (probablyduring core formation soon after accretion) was not   total and that someprimitive reservoir  in the mantle has survived. This conclusion is supported by the $^{129}$Xe results which show that oceanic sources (OIB and MORB) arestill  producing this  isotope. $^{129}$Xe is the product of the decay of $^{129}$Iwhich has a half life of only 16 x 10$^{6}$ years and  this decay schemetherefore became extinct  very early in the earth's history. 	By contrast with MORB, some OIB have very low $^{4}$He/$^{3}$He and$^{40}$Ar/$^{36}$Ar ratios,  reflecting that a component of their source region isprimitive and had not undergone early  degassing and melt extraction.
