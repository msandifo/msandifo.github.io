Thegravitational body force exerted on  material of unit volume in this field is given by theproduct of its density   and the acceleration due to gravity    (which is function of themass distribution in the Earth). The way mass is  distributed in the lithosphere is centralto the notion of {\em isostatic compensation} and the consequences of gravity acting on themass distribution in isostatically compensated lithosphere is central to all ofgeodynamics. \section{Isostasy}   It has long  been recognized that the surface elevation of the continents is in some wayrelated to the density distribution in the subsurface. The gravity field at the surface ofthe earth reflects the distribution of mass at depth and gravity measurements acrossmountain belts show that regions of high elevation generally have a deficiency of mass atdepth. That is, there is  some specific depth beneath the mountain range where the rockshave a lower density compared with rocks at the same depth beneath the low lying regionsflanking the mountain range. The gravity field shows that the deficiency of mass at depthis, to a first approximation, equal to the excess mass in the mountains, implying that atsome great depth within the earth, termed the depth of {\it isostatic compensation}, themass  of the overlaying rock is equal and independent of the  surface elevation. From thegravity data alone, it is not possible to determine exactly how the density is distributedin order to compensate the topography, and two rival isostatic models have been proposed,referred to as Pratt Isostasy and Airy Isostasy (Figure  \ref{isostasy}). These models wereproposed long before the concept of the lithosphere was formalized and in the originalformulation both models considered that isostatic compensation was achieved entirely withinthe crust.\includegraphics{Figures/Chapter_03/Figure_01.jpg}\begin{figure}[tb] %\label{isostasy} \vspace{1.25in} \hspace{0.3in}%\special{epsf=:gdfigs:chap2:Fig2_1.eps  scale=0.70} \caption{\protect\scriptsize{  Pratt(a) and Airy (b) isostasy assume rather different subsurface density distributions tocompensate the excess mass associated with the additional topography in mountains. Densitydistribution is proportional to stipling. Seismic studies beneath mountains such as theHimalayas show that the density structure approaches that of Airy Isostasy, although it isnow assumed that isostatic compensation occurs beneath the lithosphere and not at theMoho.}} \end{figure} While modern seismic methods have shown that the structure of mountain ranges closelyapproximates the Airy model, it is important to dispel the notion that compensation isgenerally achieved at the bottom of the crust. The logical place for compensation to takeplace is beneath the lithosphere, and in this course we will initially assume, and thenattempt to demonstrate, that  this is the general case.  Indeed the very existence of largelateral temperature gradients in the oceanic mantle lithosphere leads to significant horizontal density gradients. These thermally induced density changes lead to correspondingchanges in the surface elevation of the oceanic lithosphere, through a kind of thermalisostasy. The horizontal force resulting from the ocean floor topography, termed {\em ridgepush}, provides one of the fundamental driving forces for the motion and deformation of thelithosphere.  	 Isostatic compensation can be achieved because the lithosphere essentially{\it floats} on a relatively {\it inviscid} substrate: the weak peridotite of theasthenosphere. Changes in the buoyancy or elevation of the lithosphere are accommodated bydisplacement of asthenospheric mantle. However, asthenospheric mantle is not completelyinviscid (that is, its viscosity is not negligible), and its displacement in response tolithospheric loading or unloading must  take a finite length of time, related to itseffective viscosity. An insight into the timescales for the isostatic response of theasthenosphere to loads is provided by the rebound of continental lithosphere following theremoval of glacial icecaps. The rebound following the removal of the Pleistocene Laurentideicecap shows that the time scales appropriate to this isostatic response are of the orderof {$10^{4}-10^{5}$} years. Since mountain belts are built and decay on the time scale of{$10^{7}-10^{8}$} years, the isostatic response is effectively instantaneous. \section{The flexural strength of the lithosphere} 	An important question concerning isostasy is the horizontal length scale on whichisostatic compensation is achieved. Gravity measurements across mountain belts suggestthat, on the scale of several hundred kilometers, the lithosphere often approachesisostatic equilibrium. However the same measurements show that   the mass excess associatedwith  small-scale topography, for example, individual mountain peaks within mountainranges, is generally not compensated.  	 The length-scale of isostatic equilibrium (viz.,regional versus local isostatic compensation) relates to the strength of the lithosphere:on small length-scales departures from isostatic equilibrium are supported by the flexural(or elastic) strength of the lithosphere. We illustrate the interaction between theflexural strength of the lithosphere and the horizontal length scale of isostaticcompensation by considering a hypothetical infinitely strong lithosphere floating on acompletely inviscid substrate. Subject to a  substantial, localized load such as a mountainrange, such a  hypothetical lithosphere will be depressed such that the mass of thedisplaced asthenosphere is equivalent to the mass of the load. In this case the mass of themountains is compensated over the regional horizontal dimension of the lithosphere. Ofcourse gravity shows us that this is not the case for the earth, because the densitydistribution beneath mountains somehow compensates the excess mass of the mountains on alength-scale of comparable dimension to the mountains (Figure \ref{flexure}b). However, onthe smaller length scale of individual mountain peaks compensation is not achieved; that isthe lithosphere is sufficiently strong to distribute the load of an individual mountainover a length scale which is large compared to the lateral dimension of the  individualmountain.\begin{figure}[tb] \label{flexure}% \vspace{1.2in} \special{epsf=:gdfigs:chap2:Fig2_2.eps scale=0.570} \caption{\protect\scriptsize{ The response of the lithosphere (a) to appliedloads depends on its flexural strength (or  rigidity). An infinitely strong lithospherecompensates loads regionally  over the lateral dimension of the whole lithosphere (b). Atthe other end of the spectrum compensation may occur completely beneath the load, so calledlocal isostatic compensation (d). The behaviour of the lithosphere, which has some finiteflexural strength, lies somewhere between these two extremes (c), implying that thisflexural response of the lithosphere is an important component of deformation associaed with loading.For a visco-elastic lithosphere in which the response to loading is time dependent thesefigures illustrate schematically the expected temporal evolution following loading as theelastic response gives way to a viscous response through time. } } \end{figure}As we shall see, the lithosphere has a finite  flexural strength, in as much as it cansupport a limited amount of loading without permanent  deformation. The effective flexuralstrength of the lithosphere is characterized by the thickness of the elastic lithosphere,which in turn is dependent on the  thermal and compositional structure of the lithosphere.Importantly the  flexural response of the lithosphere to an applied load may be timedependent (as would be expected for a visco-elastic material); after the emplacement of aload, the effective elastic thickness of the lithosphere may decay with time as the elasticstresses are relieved by permanent deformation.\section{Gravitational potential energy } 	 {\it Isostasy is a vertical stress balance!}Local isostasy requires that at the level of isostatic compensation the mass  of overlayingrock is equalized, independently of the density distribution above this level. Equivalentlythe normal stress in the vertical direction {$\sigma_{zz}$} is equalized at the depth ofcompensation. Necessarily, the vertical density structure at, and below, the level ofcompensation must everywhere be equal. The vertical stress resulting from gravitational{\em body forces} acting on the mass, or body, of the rock. The vertical stress,{$\sigma_{zz}$}, at depth $h$ is given by: \begin{equation} \label{eq:sigma} \sigma_{zz}  =  g\, \int_{0}^{h} \, \rho\:  dz						\end{equation} where {$\rho$} is the density.Under hydrostatic conditions ($\sigma_{zz} = \sigma_{xx} = \sigma_{yy}$) the lithostaticpressure, $P$, is equal to $\sigma_{zz}$. Thus for constant density (depth independent)hydrostatic conditions:\begin{equation} \label{eq:pressure} P  =  \sigma_{zz}  =  g \,\rho\, h						\end{equation}{\it Isostasy is not a complete stress balance!} A complete stress balance requires  thathorizontal stresses as well as vertical stresses must be balanced. In order to achieve thisin the presence of a gravitational field all density interfaces must be horizontal. This isclearly not the case for the lithosphere which is characterized by significant lateralvariation in the density structure. For example,   significant topography  characterize thedensity interfaces at the Earth's surface (rock-air), the Moho (mantle-crust) and withinthe mantle lithosphere. Variations in lateral density structure within the lithospherecontribute to variations in the lithospheric gravitational potential energy, $U_l$. The gravitational potential energy of a lithospheric column of unit area is given by theintegral of the vertical stress from the surface of the earth to the base of thelithosphere (i.e.,  depth of isostatic compensation):  \begin{eqnarray} \label{pe}  U_l &=&\int_{0}^{h}\, \sigma_{zz}\:  dz   \nonumber \\  &=&  g \, \int \!\!\int_{0}^{h}\, \rho \:  dz  \nonumber \\  &=& g \int_{0}^{h}\, \left(\rho \, z \right)\: dz  \end{eqnarray} Because the lithospheric potential energy is defined in terms of  a column ofunit area it has dimensions J m$^{-2}$ or equivalently,  N m$^{-1}$.  Lateral variations ingravitational potential energy, $\Delta U_l$,  induce  substantial horizontal forces,termed {\em buoyancy forces}. The difference in potential energy between two columns, 1 and2,   integrated over the depth $h$, is (Figure \ref{buoyancy}):   \begin{eqnarray}\label{eq:bforce}   \Delta U_l &=& \int_{0}^{h}\, \sigma_{zz_{1}}\:  dz   -  \int_{0}^{h} \sigma_{zz_{2}}\:  dz  		\nonumber	\\ & = & g \,  \int_{0}^{h}\, \left(\Delta \rho \,z \right)\:   dz		  \end{eqnarray}  		  where $\Delta \rho$ is  $\left(\rho_1 -\rho_2 \right)_z$.\footnote{ The  term $\int_{0}^{h}\, \left(\Delta \rho \, z \right)\: dz$ is  referred to as the dipole moment of the density distribution.}Equation \ref{pe} and \ref{eq:bforce} simply state that in the presence of a gravitationalfield there is a tendency to reduce fluctuations in gravitational potential energy ({\itnote that these equations apply equally to the forces operating on  an ageing brie, as itspreads to lower its centre of gravity}). While variations in potential energy generallycorrelate with surface elevation it is important to realise that this is not necessarilyso, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:pe}.  \marginpar{\scriptsize{In Chapter 9 we showthat, ignoring contributions due to variations in the thermal structure of the mantlelithosphere,  for Airy isostasy the surface elevation, $h$, varies linearly with crustalthickness, $z_c$, while potential energy, $U_l$ varies with $z_c^2$  ({\em see also Chapter14, p 290, in Brown, Hawkesworth and Wilson}).}} In the absence of an externally appliedstress field, regions of high potential energy will experience tension, and regions of lowpotential energy will experience compression. \includegraphics{Figures/Chapter_03/Figure_03.jpg}\begin{figure} \label{buoyancy}% \vspace{2.3in} \hspace{0in}\special{epsf=:gdfigs:chap2:Fig2_3.eps scale=0.640 } \caption{ \protect\scriptsize{Themagnitude of the buoyancy forces arising from variations in potential energy generallycorrelate with topographic gradients on density interfaces in the lithosphere is equal tothe area between the {$\sigma_{zz}$} vs. depth curves for both regions.

Clearly column 2 is gravitationally unstable. Ina geological context this scenario may have  some relevance to old ocean lithosphere (seeChapter 7).}} \end{figure}The buoyancy forces arising from  variations in gravitational potential energy are large(in fact they provide the fundamental driving forces for the horizontal motion anddeformation in the lithosphere). These forces can be sustained because rocks have finitestrength {\em just as an immature brie does}. An understanding of the rheology of rocks,that is the way in which they respond to applied forces, is fundamental to developingquantitative tectonic models.Gravity acts on mass and  as mass is distributed throughout the volume of a body the forcesresulting from the action of gravity are termed {\it body forces} (other types of bodyforces such as magnetic forces are largely irrelevant in tectonics). As we have seen in theprevious section the effect of gravitational body forces acting on two columns withdifferent density distributions produces forces acting on the surface  between the twocolumns. Such {\it surface forces} are dependent on the area  the orientation of thesurface. Since the sum of the forces acting on a body are equal to the mass timesacceleration  (Newton's second law) it is relatively simple to derive the equations ofmotion, relating displacements and forces (see Appendix A.1). The equations of motion arenecessarily  couched in terms of the components of the stresses (or, more correctly, thestress tensor) and therefore they must be rendered  useful through  combination with equations relating stresses to displacements. Such equations, termed {\it constitutiveequations}, are material dependent and their study is the stuff of {\it rheology}. \section{Lithospheric potential energy and geoid anomalies}The contributions of  lateral variations in the density structure of the lithospheric to observed  geoid anomalies   can be directly related to the dipole moment of the density distribution:\begin{equation}\Delta N = - \frac{2 \, \pi \, G}{g} \int_{0}^{h}\, \left(\Delta \rho \, z \right)\: dz\end{equation}where $\Delta N$ is the geoid anomaly in metres. Consequently, variations in lithospheric potential energy are reflected in variations in the geoid, with an anomaly of 5 m corresponding to a variation in potential energy ofabout 1 x 10$^{12}$ N m$^{-1}$.
