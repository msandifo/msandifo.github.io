In this section we provide the essential concepts needed to utilize radiogenic isotopes as a constraint on the evolution of thesereservoirs. Three decay schemes are used extensively in the study of geodynamics: the{Rb-Sr} scheme, the {Nd-Sm} scheme and the {U-Pb} scheme. \section{Geochemical reservoirs}  Why are there distinctive geochemical reservoirs? The differentiated state of the presentEarth is largely due to the formation and segregation of {\it partial melts} in theinterior of the planet. Because magmas are less dense than the solid rocks in which theyform, they naturally migrate towards regions of lower  pressure. The keyprocess in the evolution of distinct geochemical reservoirs formed due to the segregationof partial melts is the way in which elements are partitioned between the melt and theresidual solid. A simple model for the variation in concentration of elements in magmasduring partial melting based on batch melting in which the melt stays in equilibrium withthe solid until the specified fusion proportion is:   \begin{equation}\label{eq:shaw} \frac{C_{l}}{C_{o}}    =  \frac{1}{F+D \,(1-F)} 		 	\end{equation} where{$F$} is the fraction of fusion, {$C_{o}$} is the concentration of the element in theinitial solid, {$C_{l}$} is the concentration of the element in the melt, {$ D$} is thebulk distribution coefficient: \begin{equation} \label{eq:distr} D  =   \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_{i}  K_{D_{i}} \end{equation}where  \[ K_{Di}  = \frac{X_{i}^{a}}{X_{melt}^{a}} \]   and where $n$ is the number ofmineral phases, $w$ is the weight fraction of mineral $ i$, and $X_{i}^{a} $ is theconcentration of element $a$ in phase $i$. The distribution coefficient of trace elementswith respect to specific minerals is a function of ionic charge and radius. Differentminerals have different affinities for individual trace elements and therefore different$K_D$ values. The $D$ values represent the effective {\em bulk distribution coefficient}for the whole mineral assemblage coexisting with the melt.  Trace elements that have high$D$ values are referred to as {\it compatible}, while those with $D < 1 $ are referred toas {\it incompatible}. Note that what constitutes a compatible or incompatible elementdepends on the specific mineral assemblage. Thus, Sr is an incompatible element formantle-melting involving  olivine and pyroxene assemblages whereas it is  a compatibleelement during crustal melting where feldspars are involved.  The crust is the repositoryof trace elements which are incompatible with respect to the mineralogy of the Earth'smantle.Equation \ref{eq:shaw} has a number of important special solutions (Figure\ref{shawplot}). If $D = 1$ then  $C_{l}/C_{o}  = 1$ and there is no fractionation betweensource and magma. If {$D >> 1$} then  $C_{l}/C_{o}  < 1$ and the element is preferentiallyretained in the unmelted residue. If  $D  = 0 $ then $C_{l}/C_{o}$ tends to  $1/F$  andthe trace element is strongly partitioned into the melt phase and its enrichment is simplya function of the amount of melting. Figure \ref{shawplot} also illustrates the effect ofextraction of partial melts  on the relative concentration of trace elements in theunmelted solid residue. Note that  highly incompatible elements are very quickly andefficiently extracted from the melting solid and the residues of such melting are highlydepleted in these elements.\begin{figure}[h,t,b] \label{shawplot} \vspace{3.5in} \hspace{0.5 in} \special{epsf=:gdfigs:chap5:Fig5_1.epsscale=0.75} \caption{ \protect\scriptsize{Solutions to Eqn 4.1 are shown as afunction of the proportion of fusion the degree of enrichment or depletion relative totheir source ({$C_{o}$}), of incompatible and compatible trace elements whose bulkdistribution coefficients range from zero to ten. }} \end{figure}The solution to Eqn \ref{eq:shaw} for varying amounts of melting of two trace elementsboth of which have {$D < 1$} but for which  $ D_{E_{1}} (= 0.01) < D_{E_{2}} (= 0.8) $where both elements have $C_o = 5$ppm   is shown in Figure  \ref{frac}, Figure \ref{comp}illustrates the variation of the ratio {$(E{_1}/E_{2})_{liquid}$} as a function of F.Clearly, for small to moderate amounts of melting, there is a very significantfractionation of the two trace elements; and the ultimate  destination of the melts whensegregated (i.e., the outer regions of the Earth) will become preferentially enriched in{$ E_{1}$} compared to {$E_{2}$}. By contrast, the residue of melting always has a lowerratio {$E_{1}/E_{2}$} than either the original source or the derived melt.\begin{figure}[h,t,b] \label{frac} \vspace{2.2in} \hspace{0.4in}\special{epsf=:gdfigs:chap5:Fig5_2.epsscale=1.0} \caption{ \protect\scriptsize{Concentration in the melt produced byprogressive partial fusion of trace elements whose bulk distribution coefficients are 0.01and 0.8. Initial concentration in the source was 5 ppm. Also shown is the concentration inthe residual solid  of the element whose {$D = 0.01$}. }  } \end{figure}It is important to note that  Eqn \ref{eq:shaw} describes equilibrium  batch partialmelting which assumes that the liquid remains in contact and equilibrium with the residueup to the specified degree of fusion, at which stage it is totally extracted. This is arather simplified model of the processes likely to operate in the earth  and we willdiscuss some more physically realistic mechanisms later.\begin{figure}[h,t,b] \label{comp}  \vspace{2.1in} \hspace{0.7in}\special{epsf=:gdfigs:chap5:Fig5_3.epsscale=1.0}  \caption{\protect\scriptsize{ The concentration ratio of a highlyincompatible  element ({$C_{l} (1)$}) whose {$D = 0.01$} and a moderately incompatibleelement ({$C_{l} (2)$}) whose {$D = 0.8$} in the melt formed by progressive fusion. }} \end{figure}\section{Radioactive isotopic decay}We can use the models of the type described above to infer something about thecompositions of the source regions of magmatic rocks. However, as discussed in theprevious section, partial melts of  rocks only reflect the composition of  those sourcerocks indirectly. By contrast, it is assumed that at the time of melting, the isotopiccompositions of the liquid and it's source rocks are the same and thus the initialisotopic compositions of magmas are the same as those of their source regions at the timeof melting.Naturally occurring  radioactive isotopes decay spontaneously to yield stable daughter isotopes. The rate of decay is a physical constant unique to each specific decay scheme.We refer both to the decay constant, {$\lambda$}, and to the half-life, $t_{1/2} = (ln \,2) /\lambda $, of an isotope. The half life being the time taken for half the initialnumber of parent isotope nucleiides to decay to daughter products. The equation describing radioactive decay as a function of time is: 	\begin{equation}	\label{eq:radio} 	N  =   N_{0} \, exp\left(-\lambda t \right)          \end{equation}where {$N_{0}$}  is the initial number of radioactive parent atoms  and {$N$} the numberleft after time {$t$}. The numbers of new daughter atoms, {$d^{*}$}, produced in time $t$, is given by: 	\begin{equation} \label{eq:radt}  	 	d^{*}  =  N_{0} \left(1-exp\left(-\lambda t \right) \right)  \end{equation} In most geological materials, therewill already be some of the daughter element present at the start of the time interval ofinterest which must be added to by the  products of radioactive decay. Thus the total radiogenic isotope concentration, {$d$}, of a rock or mineral is given by:\begin{equation}		d =  d_{0} + N(exp\left(-\lambda t\right) -1)			 \end{equation} and isclearly dependent on: \begin{enumerate} \item the amount of the parent isotope present atthe start,  \item the amount of the daughter isotope present at the start, {$d_{0}$} and, \item the time interval during which this system was closed, {$t$} and at this stage theamount of the parent isotope left  is {$N$}. \end{enumerate}Isotopes in geological samples are analyzed by use a mass spectrometer as  a ratiorelative to a reference non-radiogenic isotope of the same element. In the Sr-system, thereference isotope is $^{86}$Sr and in the Nd-system it is $^{144}$Nd. The so-calledisochron equation  shows that after the passage of $t$ years (in 10$^9$ units) the presentday isotope ratio of a closed system depends on its initial ratio  and the ratio  which ispurely a function of the concentration ratio of the parent and daughter elements. For theRb-Sr scheme the isochron equation is  \begin{equation}	 \label{eq:sr}	\left(\frac{^{87}Sr}{^{86}Sr}\right) =   \left(\frac{ ^{87}Sr}{^{86}Sr}\right)_{i} + \left(\frac{^{87}Rb}{^{86}Sr}\right) \left(exp\left(\lambda\, t\right) - 1\right)  \end{equation}(note that in this case $^{87}$Sr is the radiogenic isotope and $^{86}$Sr the referenceand $^{87}$Rb is the radioactive parent however we could equally apply the same equationto the other decay schemes  with appropriate decay constants).\section{Isotopic fractionation   during melting} 	 For elements of high atomic massmelting processes do not affect the ratios of two isotopes of the same element because thefractionation is the same for each. However, melting frequently does produce largefractionations between parent and daughter isotopes.  The relationship between theisotopic ratio, $\alpha$, the parent to daughter ratio, $\mu$, which is a  compositionallydependent term and the time of differentiation, $t$, in a closed system is given by	\begin{equation} \label{eq:rmelt} 	\frac{d\:\alpha}{d\:t}  =  \lambda \: \mu 		\end{equation} where $\lambda$ is the decay constant.  The importance of this isconsiderable not only for the determination  of specific rock ages, but also because it provides a connection between the chemistry of specific regions of the earth and theirradiogenic isotopic compositions. As  discussed in Section  4.1  the changes inconcentration of trace elements  in both extracted melts and in residues during fusiondepends on the $D$ value. Because parent and daughter elements will have different {$D$}values partial melting will produce melts and residues whose parent to daughter ratios aredifferent from the  source. For instance in general {$D_{Rb} < D_{Sr}$ and $D_{Sm}>D_{Nd}$. Therefore melts have higher Rb/Sr and lower Sm/Nd ratios than their sources.  	 Figure \ref{rbehav}a  illustrates the general process of the production of a new separatereservoir, {$M$}, by melting and melt extraction of a source, {$S$}, at time, {$TD$},leaving a slightly modified source region, {$R$}. This specific example is true for asituation in which the parent isotope is more incompatible than the daughter (as is thecase for Rb - Sr). If the opposite were true (as in the case of Sm-Nd), the extracted melttrajectory would be less steep than that of the residue. 	Figures \ref{rbehav}b and cillustrate two other petrogenetic processes which are also relevant. Of particularimportance is isotopic homogenisation which will occur by diffusion during geologicallymeaningful timescales at temperatures above the so-called blocking temperature. It is animportant observation that even at temperatures above the blocking temperature, the rateof diffusional equilibration between adjacent solids or non-convective, non-mixing liquidsis only of the order of  a meter in  {$10^{7}$} years. For this reason the establishmentof  large separate geochemical reservoirs like the crust  or  asthenospheric upper mantle,requires both large scale melt extraction and convective heat and mass transfer. \begin{figure}[h,t,b] \label{rbehav} \vspace{3.1in} \hspace{0.3in} \special{epsf=:gdfigs:chap5:Fig5_4.epsscale=0.75} \caption{\protect\scriptsize{ Generalized model for three broad types oftemporal control on rock  radiogenic isotopic composition. a) differentiation by partialmelting, S = source, m = melt, TD = time of melting. b) mixing of two compositionally andisotopically distinct melts at time TM to form a homogeneous hybrid.  c) Solid-stateisotopic homogenisation of two adjacent rocks masses or minerals, A and B, due tometamorphism.  } } \end{figure}\section{The chondritic earth} 	 An important process in the chemical differentiation of the earth from an initialcompositionally homogeneous globe has been  the generation and segregation of partialmelts to form several new separated reservoirs (crust, asthenosphere etc). A comprehensivegeodynamic model of the earth requires knowledge of the age, life-span and source of theseseparate regions.Because the earth has undergone continuous differentiation  since its formation at about4.55 x 10$^{9}$ years ago it is not a simple problem to determine what the bulkcomposition of the whole, undifferentiated planet  was. We only have easy access to theouter crustal portions of the earth and the entire crust only represents a smallproportion of the earth's total mass. As we have already seen, this part of the earth  hasan unrepresentative enrichment of those elements whose distribution coefficients withrespect to the mantle minerals  are very low. For instance approximately 70\%  of theearth's entire supply of K, Rb and Cs all now reside in the crust. By contrast, the Moon  which is a considerably smaller planetary body, has undergone muchless differentiation than has the earth. It's crust is much more like what we suppose it'swhole composition to be and the oldest dates obtained from Moon rocks are much closer to4.55 Ga. than the oldest terrestrial dates (Amitsoq Gneiss from S.W. Greenland dated at3.9 Ga.). This illustrates that some form of crustal re-cycling on earth has destroyedmost of the original crust, activity absent from the Moon since the earliest Proterozoic.	 Meteorites are pieces of a fragmented planetary  body (probably more than one) whichprobably occupied an orbit  between earth and Mars. Like the Moon, this appears to havehad only a short history of geological activity and was then broken-up to form theasteroid belt. Meteorites therefore represent  a unique opportunity to directly examineand analyze samples from the interior of a terrestrial planet like earth. They fall intothree groups: \begin{itemize} \item  Metallic Iron-Nickel alloy meteorites; fragments ofthe core of an earth-like planet. \item Stoney meteorites; these are mainly  silicate-richcomposed of olivine and pyroxenes and are derived from the equivalent of the earth'smantle. \item Chondritic meteorites; a unique class of meteorites which have had no hightemperature history. They are carbon-rich and often contain significant concentrations ofvolatile compounds.  \end{itemize} 	 The stoney meteorites  provide  mineral isochrons inboth the Rb-Sr and Sm-Nd systems (O'Nions et al, 1979) that indicate the age of theterrestrial planets to be 4.5 -4.55 Ga. and indicate initial  $^{87}$Rb / $^{86}$Sr and$^{143}$Nd / $^{144}$Nd ratios to be 0.69898 and  0.50682, respectively.The chondritic meteorites have not been part of a planet that has differentiated core andmantle and their bulk composition is thought to be very similar to the inter-stellar dust from which theplanets accreted. The first approximation of the whole-earth's composition is thereforethe composition of the chondritic class of meteorites and it is informative to presentdata on terrestrial samples normalized relative to this as illustrated by Figure\ref{chond}. \begin{figure}[h,t,b] \label{chond} \vspace{2.5in} \special{epsf=:gdfigs:chap5:Fig5_5.epsscale=0.95}  \caption{ \protect\scriptsize{The dashed line represents the normalized rareearth content of of a chondritic source and the normalized compositions of melts due to 1and 15\% partial fusion are shown. The residue in equilibrium with the 15\% melt is thelower most curve.}}  \end{figure} Given that we are able to define the initial Nd and Sr isotopic composition  and age ofthe Earth and we can use the composition of chondritic meteorites to define its Rb/Sr andSm/Nd ratios, we are now in a position to predict the variation in the $^{87}$Rb /$^{86}$Sr and $^{143}$Nd / $^{144}$Nd ratios for this chondritic uniform reservoir (CHUR)as a function of time (McCulloch and Wasserburg, 1978). The "mantle" lines in the the twolower diagrams in Figure \ref{res} are a representation of this reservoir.It is very common that the Sr and Nd isotopic compositions of rocks are not quoteddirectly as ratios but are compared to the expected values of the chondritic reservoir.This is referred to as epsilon, {$\epsilon$}, notation.  		 \begin{equation}\label{eq:eps} \epsilon_{Nd}\left(0\right)   = \left(\frac{\left(\frac{^{143}Nd}{^{144}Nd}\right)\left(0\right) } {I_{chur}\left(0\right) }    - 1\right)  \; {\rm x} \;10^{4} 	 \end{equation} where\begin{displaymath} I_{chur}\left(0\right) = I_{chur}\left(T\right) +\left(\frac{^{147}Sm}{^{144}Nd}_{Chur}\right) \,\left(e^{\lambda\,t} - 1\right) \\end{displaymath} \begin{displaymath} \lambda = 6.54 \; {\rm x} \;10^{12}\end{displaymath} \begin{displaymath} I_{chur}\left(0\right) = 0.512638 \; \; \;  {\rm and}\; \;  \;\frac{^{147}SM}{^{144}Nd_{chur}} = 0.1967 \end{displaymath}  $\epsilon_{Nd}\left(0\right)$(or $\epsilon_{Sr}\left(0\right)$) refer to the comparison between the present day valueof the chondritic reservoir and the present day isotope value of the sample (ie themeasured value). If this rock is not of zero age and if the age is known, then its initial isotopic composition at  its age, {$T$}, can be calculated  and compared to thechondritic reservoir at that time, {$\epsilon_{Nd}\left(T\right)$} and{$\epsilon_{Sr}\left(T\right)$}. In the upper diagram of Figure \ref{res}, the axes couldequally be presented as isotope ratio values or $\epsilon$ values. The "bulk earth"position in this diagram is the intersection point of $\epsilon_{Nd}\left(0\right)$ = 0and {$\epsilon_{Sr}\left(0\right)$} = 0. This figure shows the field modern day oceanisland basalts (OIB) and mid ocean ridge basalt (MORB). These reflect the composition ofthe present day mantle and show that though some ocean island magmatism is sampling mantlewhose composition is close to the predicted chondritic Earth, the modern mantle shows somevery strong deviation from this model. This is particularly so for those portions of themantle sampled by the voluminous magmatic production at the mid ocean ridges. On this samediagram from Figure \ref{res}, the field of continental crust is also shown. This has high$^{87}$Rb / $^{86}$Sr (or positive $\epsilon_{Sr}$) values and low $^{143}$Nd / $^{144}$Nd(or negative $\epsilon_{Nd}$) values. As the  range of Sm/Nd ratios of continental rocksis relatively limited, Eqn \ref{eq:eps} reduces to express $^{143}$Nd / $^{144}$Nd as afunction of time and this is illustrated as the age contours in the continental crustalquadrant in Figure \ref{res}. Note that this is not so for $^{87}$Rb / $^{86}$Sr as thereis a very large range of Rb/Sr values for common crustal rocks.  \begin{figure}[h,t,b]\label{res} \vspace{6in} \special{epsf=:gdfigs:chap5:Fig5_6.epsscale=0.9} \caption{\protect\scriptsize{Upper: Present day Nd - Sr isotopic covariations for important terrestrial reservoirs.MORB is mid ocean ridge basalts, OIB is ocean island basalts. Lower: Sr- and Nd-timeevolutionary diagrams. $T_{ model}$ is a model age.  	Data for the ocean island basalts suggests that  in addition to the depleted domain there  still exists a mantle reservoirthat has not suffered relative Rb and Nd depletion. There is some suggestion  that this isa lower mantle or lower upper mantle reservoir which still has a chondrite-like chemistry.This region is also a probable source of rare gas emissions including the now extinct$^{129}$Xe suggestive of long term isolation without melt extraction. Ifthis were true it would have important implications in constraining the extent anddimensions of mantle convective cells.}}  \end{figure}\section{The depleted mantle}Figure \ref{chond} shows that for the partial fusion of a chondritic source like thatassumed to represent the undifferentiated earth, the degree of total rare earth elementenrichment in the melt diminishes with larger amounts of melting and that the residualsource is depleted in these incompatible elements. More importantly, the melts have lowerSm/Nd ratios than the original pristine source and the residue has a higher Sm/Nd ratio.To a simplified first approximation (with respect to the rare earth elements), Figure\ref{chond} illustrates the  evolution of the two important terrestrial geochemicalreservoirs: \begin{itemize} \item a melt repository (= crust) and, \item a  source regiondepleted in the crust forming elements by crustal extraction (= some part of the presentmantle). \end{itemize}  The lower two diagrams in Figure \ref{res} show the present dayrange of Nd and Sr isotopic compositions of the continental crust with respect to a mantlereservoir. These  represent simplifications of the true situation, because (Figure\ref{chond}) the extraction of melts from the mantle bring about complimentary changes tothe composition of that mantle. A mantle region that has suffered partial melting and meltextraction will have higher Sm/Nd and lower Rb/Sr and U/Pb ratios than the originalchondritic unmelted mantle. Mid-ocean ridge basalts are melts of the contemporary decompressed asthenospheric mantlebeneath the oceanic ridges. Even though these are melts they have rare earth patternswhich are like the solid residue  in Figure \ref{chond} and are strongly  LREE-depleted.This suggests they are the products of remelting of mantle that has already lost  a meltcomponent before. In Figure \ref{res}, the MORB field is at high $\epsilon_{Nd}$ and low$\epsilon_{Sr}$  confirming that their source mantle had achieved its  depleted chemistryover a long period of geological time (perhaps 2 Ga). We then view the continents as beingcomplimentary to the depleted mantle now being sampled by mid ocean ridge magmatism. Theaverage age of the continental crust is given by: \begin{equation}		 <T> = \int_{0}^{T}\,\tau_{m}\, \left(\tau\right) \, dt \end{equation} where  $\tau_{m}$ is the mass ofincrement of crustal addition aged $\tau$.
