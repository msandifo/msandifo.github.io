At the most basic level the processes that govern the Earth's behaviour are simple physical consequences of this reality, combined with the constraints imposed by the materials that make up the Earth.  In particular, heat transfer operates to disperse this thermal energy fluctuation \footnote{An important question, to which we return to at the end of this course, concerns the geodynamic consequences of the long-term, secular changes in the thermal state of the Earth due to this dispersal of the thermal energy fluctuation.} while self-gravitation serves to hold the mass-anomaly together.  In order to understand why the Earth is the way it is, and how it evolves in time, it is necessary to understand the consequences of these two, simple, physical processes.  The intricate structure of the Earth, at all scales, is a direct consequences of these physical processes, and why it is made of the materials that it is.  Moreover, these processes are responsible for the great diversity and beauty of our planet that provides the basic motivation for much of the Earth Science community -- {\em a motivation that should not be forgotten}.\section{A useful description?}Dynamicists are concerned with changes (equivalently, motions) accompanying the passage of time in dynamical systems.  The system of concern to the geodynamicist is the Earth and our geological perspective focuses our interest primarily on the {\em lithosphere} (on which we reside) and, less directly, the {\em asthenosphere}.  Consequently, geodynamics is primarily concerned with the basic physical processes that modulate the time evolution of the lithosphere; with one of its principal aims being the {\em description of the behaviour} of the lithosphere in the modern Earth.In order to develop an appropriate geodynamic description we need tounderstand what constitutes utility.  To be useful, the dynamicaldescription must reduce some aspect (optimistically, all aspects) ofthe behaviour of a complex system to a few general statements.  Ingeodynamics, in which our concern is primarily with the motion of thelithosphere and the forces that drive the motion, we may distinguishbetween descriptions that are concerned solely with the motion or {\itkinematics} without regard to the forces or, alternatively, {\itmechanical} descriptions concerned with the interaction between forcesand motions.The kinematic description is far less formidable than the mechanicaldescription and has received considerably more attention asillustrated by {\it plate tectonics}\index{plate tectonics}.  Platetectonics attempts {\it nothing more} than a description of the motionof the lithosphere, and as such is purely kinematic.  The fundamentaltenets of the plate tectonic description are: \begin{enumerate} \itemThe lithosphere is composed of only a few rigid {\it plates} thatdeform only at their boundaries.  That is, plate motions can bedescribed in terms of translation and rotation.  \item The deformingplate boundaries are very narrow in comparison to the lateraldimensions of the individual plates.  \end{enumerate} Platetectonics\index{plate tectonics} can only provide a useful descriptionif the number of plates remains small; if large numbers of plates areneeded to describe the behaviour of the lithosphere, then thedescription becomes sufficiently complicated to be rendered useless.Does plate tectonics provide a useful description of the behaviour ofthe lithosphere?  Our prejudice concerning the answer to this question-- {\it only in part} -- provides the key to the way in which wepresent the subject matter.  Let us explain!  Since every seismicevent represents a deformation of the lithosphere, a logicalconsequence of the plate tectonic description is that a plate boundaryshould be drawn through the focal point of every seismic event (or,earthquake).  In the ocean basins seismicity\index{seismicity} isrestricted to very narrow zones along the mid ocean ridges, subductionzones and transform zones, that are separated by large, essentiallyaseismic regions.  The lack of seismicity over large regions withinthe ocean basins implies that, to a first approximation, they dobehave as rigid, or elastic, {\it plates}.  In contrast, seismicity inthe continents is widely distributed, even in relatively inactivecontinents such as Australia, with very large areas of intense,distributed seismicity.  The most notable regions of distributedseismicity in the modern earth are the Basin and Range Province in thewestern USA\index{Basin and Range Province}, theHimalaya\index{Himalaya} - Tibet\index{Tibet} region in Asia and inthe Aegean Sea\index{Aegean Sea} (which is floored by thin continentalcrust) in Europe.  In these locations, active deformation is takingplace over vast areas, which are equally as large as the surroundingaseismic regions.  In order to adequately account for such deformationthe plate tectonic description would need to invoke hundreds ofthousands of individual plates each with lateral dimensions of only afew kilometers.Clearly, while plate tectonics may provide a useful description of theocean basins it usefulness for many continental regions is doubtful.Indeed, an alternative description of the continents as essentiallycontinuous ductile media (rather than elastic plates) and whichtherefore effectively ignores the existence of any discontinuities inthe strain field such as faults and, more importantly, plateboundaries is useful for many purposes and will be the description wewill emphasize here. \section{The tectonic agenda} At the very outset it is useful to establish our agenda in relation to other Earth science studies, such as structural geology, petrology, sedimentology, geomorphology and seismology.  The overlap with these fields is substantial, but significant differences remain. We will be concerned primarily with those processes that give rise to the large-scale, regular (or so-called first-order) features that characterize the modern Earth.  For example, we will be explicitly interested in understanding the controls on \begin{itemize} \item the average elevation of the surface of the earth, \item the length-scales of deformation in active mountain belts, \item the gross chemical composition of the continental crust, and \item the normal thermal regime in the lithosphere.  \end {itemize} {\em We give due warning } that we will not generally be concerning ourselves with the small-scale, higher-order variations in topography, strain, composition, and thermal regimes that are very much the stuff of geomorphology, structural geology and petrology, respectively.  For example, we will ignore such things as the detailed lithostratigraphic record of individual sedimentary basins, but we will expend considerable effort in trying to understand the controls on subsidence within basins in general.  Similarly, the role of assimilation, fractionation and crystallisation that leads to the great variation of magma types that so {\em excite igneous petrologists} will be overlooked in favour of the general nature of the processes that lead to large-scale melting events and the way in which these processes naturally give rise to the characteristic chemical signature of the average melt product.The {\em great challenge and fun} of the geological enterprise lies indeciphering the effects of the first-order processes from thehigher-frequency geological {\em noise} that make the geologicalrecord so complex (and, let it be said, at the same time so rich).From the geodynamic point of view the distinction between thefirst-order processes and the high-frequency noise is readilyappreciated once the significance of the lithosphere as thefundamental tectonic entity is acknowledged.  This implies forfirst-order features a natural length scale of the order of 100 km (orgreater), as dictated by the thickness of the lithosphere, and naturaltimescales of the order of 10-100 Ma (at least), as dictated by thethermal response time of the lithosphere.{\em Where from comes the noise?} At least a large part of the richand diverse geological noise is modulated by exogenic processes.  Forexample, whereas landscapes are very regular when viewed at the 10$^5$-- 10$^6$ m-scale (ie., at lithospheric scales), erosion and gullyinghave natural length-scales that produce very fragmented landscapes onthe 10$^1$--10$^4$ m-scale.  \footnote{ In fact, at the10$^{-1}$ -- 10$^5$ m-scale landscapes are fractal with a dimensiontypically betweeen 2.0 and 2.2 -- as discussed in Mandelbrot'swonderfully idiosyncratic tome {\em The fractal geometry of nature}.} Similarly, exogenic forcing, as for example associated withMilankovitch cycles, with natural time scales (10$^2$ --10$^6$ a) thatare very short compared to the thermal time constant of thelithosphere (10$^7$ a), influence the third- to fifth-order sequenceboundaries that are so obvious in the lithostratigraphic record at the10$^{-1}$ -- 10$^2$ m-scale.  \footnote{See Chapter 20(specifically figure 20.10, p.  399) in Brown, Hawkesworth and Wilsonfor a discussion of sequence stratigraphy.} It is the {\emrheological anisotropy} caused by this short-wavelength lithologicalvariation which is responsible for the structural chaos of orogeniczones when viewed at the map scale, and is the detail which we seek{\em quite deliberately} to avoid.\section{What is the lithosphere?} As we have emphasized one of our primary concerns is to provide an insight into the nature and behaviour of lithosphere\index{lithosphere} and, particularly, the processes that contribute to its formation.  To begin with we need some common idea of what constitutes the lithosphere.  We provide two working definitions (Figure 1.1): \begin{enumerate} \item The {\it thermal lithosphere}\index{thermal lithosphere} is that part of the earth where the dominant mode of heat transfer is conduction (Figure 1.1a). \item \footnote{This definition of the kinematic or mechanical lithosphere admits the precise form \[ \frac{\partial{v_{x,y}}}{\partial{z}} = 0 \] where {$v_{x,y}$} is the horizontal component of the velocity field, and {$z$} is depth.}  The {\it kinematic (or mechanical) lithosphere} is that part of the earth where there are no substantial vertical gradients in the horizontal component of the velocity field (Figure 1.1b).  Of course, large horizontal gradients in the horizontal component of the lithospheric velocity field occur because rotation of the lithosphere around vertical poles may occur without appreciable internal deformation.  \end{enumerate} Both definitions allow the distinction of the lithosphere from the underlying asthenosphere, where heat transfer is primarily by convection, and which is, as a consequence, characterized by large vertical gradients in the horizontal component of the velocity field.\begin{figure}[h,t]\includegraphics{../Figures/Chapter_01/Figure_01.jpg}  \caption{\protect  The outer part of the earth can bedivided into two distinct zones, the kinematic or mechanicallithosphere (heavy stipple) and the asthenosphere (light stipple)separated by a boundary layer (intermediate stipple) which showstransitional properties.  In the lithosphere heat is transported byconduction and thus the geotherm, shown in Figure 1.1a, is a strongfunction of depth, whereas in the underlying asthenosphere heat istransferred by convection and the geotherm is an adiabat.  In thelithosphere there are no significant vertical gradients in thehorizontal component of the velocity field (represented by the arrowsin Figure 1.1b).  Formally the thermal boundary layer is included withthe mechanical lithosphere as part of the thermal lithosphere.  TheMoho, or crust-mantle boundary, lies within the mechanical lithosphereas indicated by the dashed line.  }\end{figure}The lithosphere comprises the crust as well as a significant part ofthe upper mantle, down to a depth of ~ 100 - 150 km.  The exactthickness of the lithosphere is not easily determined by conventionalgeophysical methods such as seismology since the lower boundary of thelithosphere, the lithosphere - asthenosphere boundary, is not definedby a prominent compositional discontinuity.  Rather it is defined bychanges in the rheology of the mantle-forming rock, peridotite.\footnote{   The coefficient of thermal expansion,{$\alpha$}, and the coefficient of compressibility, {$\beta$}, aredefined as: \[ \alpha = \frac{1}{V} \,\left(\frac{\partial{V}}{\partial{T}}\right)_{P} \] \[ \beta =-\frac{1}{V}\,\left(\frac{\partial{V}}{\partial{P}}\right)_{T} \]where $V$ is volume.  }  Since the composition of the mantle isessentially constant throughout, mantle density, {$\rho_{m} $}, isdependent primarily on the temperature (through the volumetriccoefficient of thermal expansion, {$\alpha$}) and the confiningpressure (through the coefficient of compressibility, {$\beta$}).  Anincrease in the temperature causes a decrease in density, while anincrease in pressure causes an increase in density.  At a constantdepth and hence at constant pressure small lateral changes intemperature result in variations in the density.  The strength of allmaterials, including peridotite, is a function of temperature; atasthenospheric temperatures (approximately {$1300 ^{o}$C}) peridotite( for peridotite {$\alpha$} is about {$10^{-5}\, ^{o}$K$^{-1}$}) issufficiently weak that it will convect in response to stressesresulting from the density variations associated with small lateraltemperature gradients whereas in the lithosphere peridotite issufficiently strong that it does not undergo convection (although itmay subduct as an essentially rigid slab).  Since the rheologicalproperties of peridotite are likely to be a continuous function oftemperature in the range appropriate to the base of the lithospherethere must be a transition zone separating the lithosphere andasthenosphere.  This zone is termed the {\em lower thermal boundarylayer} and is formally included in the thermal lithosphere, butexcluded from the mechanical lithosphere (Figure 1.1).It is important to realise that these definitions make no directcorrespondence between the lithosphere and the compositional structureof the earth.  The compositional structure of the earth is constrainedin a number of ways, most notably by the seismic velocity structuredetermined by the way in which seismic energy is radiated followinglarge earthquakes.  This approach leads to the distinction of threecompositionally distinct shells within the earth bounded by prominentdiscontinuities in the seismic velocity structure, namely {\em thecrust, the mantle and the core}.  The crust is typically about 6-7 kmthick beneath the oceans and 30-50 km thick in the continents withmaximum thicknesses of about 70 km beneath the great mountain belts.The detailed velocity structure of the continental crust is complexreflecting a complex compositional structure and history.  Incomparison the velocity structure of the mantle is more regular withweak discontinuities at about 450 and 650 km, consistent with phasetransitions in material with the composition of peridotite.  The 650km discontinuity, corresponding to the maximum pressure stabilitylimit of the silicate spinel structure, is commonly taken as theboundary between the upper and lower mantle.  A low seismic velocityregion is sometimes present in the upper mantle at depths between100-200 km.  In this scheme, the lower boundary of the lithosphereoccurs within the upper mantle probably at depths appropriate to thelow velocity zone at around 100-200 km.  However, it should be notedthat the low velocity zone is not universally present and thereforecannot be used to define the base of the lithosphere.\section{About these notes}Already we have suggested that we may need two descriptions toencompass the dynamics of the outer part of the earth; one for theoceans and one for the continents.  While this is undoubtedly asimplification, it does suggest a natural subdivision of the subject.In Part 2 we discuss the oceans, about which we have a deeperunderstanding than the continents (Part 3).  Our main aim will be todevelop a description of the mechanics of the lithosphere, and so wewill be concerned with the nature of the forces driving the motion ofthe lithosphere (which are reviewed in part 4).  To do this we willneed to incorporate constraints on the mechanism of formation of thelithosphere which requires an understanding of the geochemicalrelationships between the crust and mantle as well as lithosphere andasthenosphere.  Before we do so it is important to review somefundamental principles which are essential to understanding thedynamics of both the oceanic and the continental lithosphere (Part 1).  A vexing questionconcerning the preparation of the notes is what level of mathematics should beincluded.  Many of the important physical processes in tectonics admit veryconcise mathematical definitions, and therefore mathematics provides a naturalway to describe the processes. However, we will try to describe the basicphysics and have only included the most important of the mathematicaldefinitions in the main body of the text. Peripheral mathematical definitionsare included either as marginal notes or in the appendices. For those of youwho struggle with the language of mathematics we hope that a qualitativeappreciation of the nature of the physical process will provide a new avenueto understanding the mathematical description; certainly this is how we havelearned to tackle the mathematics.
