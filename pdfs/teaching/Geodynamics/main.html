However, this complexity, which requires   documentation through careful observation and analysis, may belie relatively   simple principles and symmetries (such as time invariance) which govern the   dynamics, and which can only be understood by generalization and abstraction.   In many intriguing ways these two different approaches lead in opposing directions   and the tension thus created provides the lifeblood of our science. While the   different approaches may require very different skills and temperaments, both   are important to the development of our science, no one more so than the other.   This course fundamentally (and unashamedly) concerns the results and outcomes   of the process of generalization (in which the Earth is necessarily considered   a very simple beast responding to simple pleasures provided by the laws of nature).   However, more than anything else, the questions addressed, and conclusions articulated,   here represent the fruits of many hours spent observing at the outcrop scale   where geology can appear very complex, indeed. While I believe many benefits   accrue from the world-view that results from the process of generalization,   I begin with an important disclaimer: careful observation and analysis will   always be remembered and used long after once fashionable interpretation has   been ridiculed and disbanded. After all, the time-honored tradition of the sciences   is that, like biological species, theories have a finite lifespan.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1"><img src="../../../Images/Geophysical/Global/mixed/global_data.gif" width="700" height="454"></font></p><h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1"><b>History</b></font></h3><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">These pages contain an   online version of my text "Lithospheric dynamics" developed to accompany a course   at Adelaide University from 1990-1999 in conjunction with John Foden, and now   at Melbourne University. The text is intended for senior undergraduate students.</font></p><p> <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">The text was prepared in   LaTeX, mostly prior to 1994. To view the latex version directly in a browser   you will need to download a version of IBM's techexplorer Hypermedia Browser,   which can be obtained from <a href="http://www-4.ibm.com/software/network/techexplorer/">http://www-4.ibm.com/software/network/techexplorer/</a>   </font></p><H3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1"> Acknowledgements </font></H3><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">The many students whom   struggled through my courses wondering what on earth I was on about have contributed   (albeit mostly in an unwitting way) to my undesrtanding of both the subject   matter and its presentation. Many associates have also contributed either directly   or indirectly. I am particularly indebted to John Foden, who wrote most of the   chapter on "Isotope dynamics", and whom, apart form his great friendship, helped   develop the a great course, way back then when Universities were about learning!   Others deserving some sort of acknowledgement (even if I can't quirte remember   what for) include Simon Turner, Thomas Flottmann, Roger Powell, Martin Hand,   David Coblentz..... </font></p></BODY> </html>
