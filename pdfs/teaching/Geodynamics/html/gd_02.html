The mid-ocean ridges represent submerged   volcanic mountain ranges, with an average depth beneath sea level of 2-3 km.   Broad swells in the elevation of the ridges occur along their length and locally   the ridges are exposed, as is the case in Iceland. The depth of the ocean floor   increases systematically away from the ridges, corresponding to time dependent   changes in the density structure of the upper mantle beneath the ageing oceanic   lithosphere, as reflected for example in the geoid (see Section 7.1). The depth   beneath the ridges above 40 Ma oceanic crust is about 2 km, while for 80 Ma   old oceanic crust it is about 3 km. The average depth of the ocean waters is   therefore clearly related to the age of the oceanic lithosphere, which in turn   is related to the rate of generation (spreading rate) of new oceanic lithosphere   at ridges (see Section 5.2). In trenches, which mark the sight of subduction   of old oceanic lithosphere water depths may reach 10 km. </p><p> This regular pattern of oceanic bathymetry is disturbed by: <ul>  <p>   <li> <em>Guyots and sea-mounts</em> From the point of view of the history of     understanding seafloor evolution, now submerged, but once exposed, oceanic     seamounts termed <em>guyots</em> are an important morphological feature of     the ocean basins. These features show, unequivocally, that the change in bathymetry     of the mean sea-floor with distance form the ridge corresponds to a temporal     sequence of subsidence, and thus coroborates the interpretation of sea-floor     spreading based on the observed symmetrical magnetic striping of the ocean     floors.   <li> <em>Fracture zones</em> </ul><p> <h4>Continental topography</h4><p>The continents have a mean elvation of several hundered meters above sea-level   with a range from about 300 meters below sea-level (at the break in the continental   shelf) up to about 8 km at Mt. Everest. At the 100 km - scale,the highest average   elevation is only 5 km. </p><p> Continental landscapes provide one of the most dramatic of natural fractal   surfaces. The characteristic feature of the fractal is the statitiscal scale-invariance,   that is the general character of the surface looks the same independent of the   scale of observation. For landscapes this is strictly true only over a limited   range of scales (10<sup>-1</sup>m - 10<sup>5</sup> m). The invariance of landscapes   on this range of scales suggests that the processes operating to sculpt the   landscape (i.e., erosion, mass wastage and deposition) are either scale-invariant   themselves or that when acting together produce the scale-invariant effect.   Erosion acts to roughen landscape at a wide range of scales while both mass   wastage and deposition act to smooth the landscape, at the short and long-wavelength,   respectively. <p> <h2><a name="tth_sEc2.2"> 2.2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;The geoid</h2><p>Because of the inviscid nature of water (when viewed at geological time-scales)   the mean sea-level represents gravitational equipotential surface in the earths   gravitational field and therefore its elevation can be related to the density   distribution at depth (as well as the the orbital dynamics of the Earth which   cause an ellipticity in mass distribution and hence in the equipotential surfaces).   The observed geoid height, as determined from the mean sea-level elevation,   is expressed in terms of an anomaly relative to some fixed elevation (i.e.,   the predicted geoid for an idealised sphercially symmetric, rotating mass distribution). </p><p> Variations in the gravitational potential energy of the lithosphere, <font face=symbol>D</font>U<sub>l</sub>, correlate with the dipole moment of the near-surface density distribution   and therefore they can be directly related to the lithospheric component of   the observed geoid anomalies, <font face=symbol>D</font>N<sub>l</sub> : <center>  <table border=0 align=center>    <tr>      <td>         <table align=left>          <tr>            <td nowrap align=center> <font face=symbol>D</font>U<sub>l</sub> = </td>            <td nowrap align=center> g<sup>2</sup>              <hr NOSHADE>              2 &nbsp;<font face=symbol>p</font>&nbsp;G<br>            </td>            <td nowrap align=center> &nbsp;<font face=symbol>D</font>N<sub>l</sub> </td>        </table>      </td>  </table></center><p>where g is the gravitational acceleration, and G is the gravitational constant   (note that the potential energy varies with the geoid anomaly as approximately   0.23 x 10<sup>12</sup> N m<sup>-1</sup> per meter). The main problem with using   this relationship is resolving the lithospheric contribution of the geoid anomalies   from the much larger amplitude anomalies associated with the dynamic processes   of plate tectonics and mantle convection. </p><p> Positive geoid anomalies of up to 10 - 15 m associated with a number of mid-ocean   ridge segments, as well as age-correlated geoid offsets across fracture zones   imply that ageing of the ocean lithosphere is accompanied by a decline in potential   energy. The geoid anomaly predicted for the cooling half-space model (as well   as the thermal plate model) for young ocean lithosphere is about d &nbsp;(<font face=symbol>D</font>N<sub>o</sub> )/d &nbsp;t = - 0.15 m/Ma, which compares favourably with the observed   geoid anomaly over the Mid-Atlantic Ridge at 44.5<sup>o</sup>N, and elsewhere,   as well as with the geoid offsets across fracture zones. The total geoid anomaly   of -12.7 m over 84 Ma corresponds decline in U<sub>l</sub> of 2.9 x 10<sup>12</sup>   N m<sup>-1</sup>. <p> In comparison with the mid-ocean ridges, the geoid anomalies associated with   continental margins and the interior of continents are far less clear. On the   basis of averages taken over large areas there appears to be no systematic difference   in the geoid height between old ocean basins (older than Cretaceous) and continental   masses. Such an interpretation implies that the mean potential energy of the   continental lithosphere is equivalent to old ocean basins. However, the data   show very substantial differences between continents, with the mean geoid of   the African continent some 40 m higher than the North American continent and   10 m higher than the mean for the Atlantic and Pacific ocean basins older than   Cretaceous. This observed intercontinental variation far exceeds the plausible   lithospheric contributions to geoid anomalies and therefore must reflect long-wavelength   sub-lithospheric contributions. Moreover, a number of continental margins are   characterized by distinct positive anomalies of the order 6 m across the transition   from the ocean basin to sea-level continent and imply that a continental lithospheric   column supporting sea level elevation has the potential energy equivalent to   ocean lithosphere of age about 44 Ma. <p> Since the lithospheric contribution to the geoid anomaly reflects the dipole   moment of the near-surface density distribution, the observed geoid anomalies   across continental margins can also be used to constrain the continental lithospheric   density structure. A lithospheric thickness of 125 km and a crustal density   of 2750 kg /m<sup>3</sup> is consistent with a continental marginal geoid anomaly   of + 6 m. Moreover, such a density structure is consistent with the interpretation   that an isostatically compensated continental lithospheric column supporting   about 1 km of surface elevation above sea level is in potential energy balance   with the mid-ocean ridges. While the generally poor resolution of the geoid   in mountainous regions precludes definitive correlation between topography and   potential energy within the continents, some evidence of the correlation is   provided by the lithospheric contribution to the geoid anomaly of 24 - 27 m   for the Andean Altiplano. Such inferences are consistent with a geoid that varies   with continental topography as 6 - 7 m/km, corresponding to a potential energy   variation of about 1.3 x 10<sup>12</sup> N m<sup>-1</sup>. For a continent with   an average elevation of 500 m, this correlation suggests a mean continental   potential energy of 0.997 x U<sub>MOR</sub> <p> <h2><a name="tth_sEc2.3"> 2.3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Heat flow</h2><p>Since the lithosphere represents a conductive lid to mantle convection the   variation in heat flow measured at the surface provides insight into the vertical   structure of the lithosphere. </p><p> In the ocean lithosphere, the highest heat flow regions are associated with   mid-ocean ridges, where absolute values are very variable (50-300 mW m<sup>-2</sup>)   due to intense, but localised, hydrothermal activity. In older, deeper lithosphere   the heat flow measurements become less variable and gradually decline. The decline   in heat flow approximates the same dependence on t<sup>0.5</sup> as bathymetry.   This <em> age-bathymetry-heatflow</em> law for ocean lithosphere which provides   one of the most profound insights into the structure of the lithosphere (see   Chapter 7). <p> <h2><a name="tth_sEc2.4"> 2.4</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Active seismicity</h2><p>The distribution of seismicity in the lithosphere provides a direct &#223napshot"   of the active deformation. </p><p> <h2><a name="tth_sEc2.5"> 2.5</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;The <i>in-situ</i> stress field</h2><p>The orientation of the stress field in the lithsophere provides an imprtant   constraint on mechanisms driving plate motion (see Chapter 10). </p></body></html>
