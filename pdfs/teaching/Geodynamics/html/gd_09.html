More than   anything else, this complexity reflects the very strong mechanical anisotropy   of crustal rocks; that is, the structural geometry resulting from the deformation   is largely a consequence of the inherited structure and is only weakly coupled   to the nature of the forces driving the deformation. Indeed this complexity   begs the question as to whether it is possible, or even useful to attempt, to   evaluate the parameters governing the geodynamic evolution of continental orogenic   belts. However, some of the most impressive large scale features of orogenic   belts are much more regular than their internal structural geometry. For example,   the topography of orogenic belts, while very fragmented (fractal) on small scales,   is very regular at the scale of the orogenic belt. Indeed, just as an understanding   on the control on topographic variation in the ocean basins provides fundamental   insights, understanding the controls on topography provides very important insights   into the mechanics of continental orogens. <p> We begin by examining the controls and some consequences of topography and   potential enegrgy using simple calculations based on the assumption of local   isostatic equilibrum. This assumption is only likely to be valid for thermally   mature orogenic systems which have started to develop plataeus (e.g., Tibet)   or, in extension, wide basins, in which the deformation of the lithsophere is   induced by forces applied as <em>end loads</em>. The margins of orogenic belts   involving wedge shaped thrust belts are certainly not in isostatic equilbrium   and so the topographic variation in such circumstances need to be evaluated   using a differnet set of <em>boundary conditions</em>. To tackle the mechanics   of the frontal parts of mountain belts, and accretionar wedges, we need to investigate   the dynamics of <em>critical wedges</em>, where the driving forces are imparted   to the deforming crust as <em>basal tractions</em> along some kind of master   thrust or decollement. <p> <h2><a name="tth_sEc9.1"> 9.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Deformation of the lithosphere subject   to an end load</h2><p>Any consideration of the behaviour of the continental lithsophere during deformation   needs to recognise the contrasting influence of the crust and the mantle lithosphere   in mediating both the thermal and isostatic response: </p><ul>  <li><em>The crust</em> represents the buoyant part of the lithosphere as well     as the part where lithospheric heat production is concentrated. Thickening     of the crust therefore increases the buoyancy and potential energy of the     lithospheric column, as well as steepening the geotherm through the increase     in the heat production in the thickened column.   <li><em>The mantle lithosphere</em> represents the dense negatively buoyant     part of the lithosphere, which is relatively devoid of heat producing elements.     Thickening of the mantle lithosphere therefore reduces the buoyancy and potential     energy of the isostatically equilibrated column as well suprressing the geotherm     in the overlying crust by reducing the heat flow into the base of the crust.     <p> </ul><p>Because of this contrasting influence it is useful to consider the effects   of the crust and mantle lithosphere, independently. This can be achieved by   describing the deformation of the lithosphere by the ratio of the changes in   thickness of the crust, f<sub>c</sub>, and mantle lithosphere, f<sub>m</sub>,   where these are defined at any stage of the deformation by: </p><center>  <table border=0 align=center>    <tr>      <td>         <table align=left>          <tr>            <td nowrap align=center> f<sub>c</sub> = </td>            <td nowrap align=center> z<sub>c</sub>              <hr NOSHADE>              z<sub>c0</sub><br>            </td>            <td nowrap align=center> </td>        </table>      </td>  </table></center><center>  <table border=0 align=center>    <tr>      <td>         <table align=left>          <tr>            <td nowrap align=center> f<sub>m</sub> = </td>            <td nowrap align=center> z<sub>m</sub>              <hr NOSHADE>              z<sub>m0</sub><br>            </td>            <td nowrap align=center> </td>        </table>      </td>  </table></center><p>where z<sub>c</sub> and z<sub>m</sub> are the deformed thickness of the crust   and mantle lithosphere, respectively, and z<sub>c0</sub> and z<sub>m0</sub>   are the initial thickness of crust and mantle lithosphere prior to deformation. </p><p> <h3>Airy Isostasy and crustal thickening</h3><p>Assuming Airy isostasy then crustal thickening results in both an increase   in surface elevation, c<sub>h</sub>, and the the development of the crustal   root, c<sub>r</sub>. </p><p> <p><a name="tth_fIg9.1"> </a> <a name="cthick"> </a>   <center>    Figure 9.1: <font size="-3"> Isostatic effects of crustal thickening. </font>  </center><p> <p> For a crust of constant density, <font face=symbol>r</font><sub>c</sub>, overlying mantle of density <font face=symbol>r</font><sub>m</sub>, the ratio of the change in surface elevation c<sub>h</sub> to the   thickness of the crustal root c<sub>r</sub> is given by <center>  <table border=0 align=center>    <tr>      <td>         <table align=left>          <tr>            <td nowrap align=center> </td>            <td nowrap align=center> c<sub>h</sub>              <hr NOSHADE>              c<sub>r</sub><br>            </td>            <td nowrap align=center> = </td>            <td nowrap align=center> <font face=symbol>r</font><sub>m</sub> - <font face=symbol>r</font><sub>c</sub>              <hr NOSHADE>              <font face=symbol>r</font><sub>c</sub><br>            </td>            <td nowrap align=center> </td>        </table>      </td>  </table></center><p>The change in crustal thickness is given by the sum of c<sub>h</sub> + c<sub>r</sub>: </p><center>  <table border=0 align=center>    <tr>      <td>         <table align=left>          <tr>            <td nowrap align=center> f<sub>c</sub> = </td>            <td nowrap align=center> c<sub>h</sub> + c<sub>r</sub> + z<sub>c0</sub>              <hr NOSHADE>              z<sub>c</sub>0<br>            </td>            <td nowrap align=center> </td>        </table>      </td>  </table></center><p>giving </p><center>  <table border=0 align=center>    <tr>       <td>         <table align=left>          <tr>             <td nowrap align=center> c<sub>r</sub> = f<sub>c</sub> &nbsp;z<sub>c0</sub>-               c<sub>h</sub> - z<sub>c0</sub> </td>        </table>      </td>  </table></center><p>Therefore </p><center>  <table border=0 align=center>    <tr>      <td>         <table align=left>          <tr>            <td nowrap align=center> c<sub>h</sub> = z<sub>c0</sub>(1 -f<sub>c</sub>               ) </td>            <td align=left class="cl"><font face=symbol> æ<br>              ç<br>              è </font></td>            <td nowrap align=center> <font face=symbol>r</font><sub>c</sub>-<font face=symbol>r</font><sub>m</sub>              <hr NOSHADE>              <font face=symbol>r</font><sub>c</sub><br>            </td>            <td align=left class="cl"><font face=symbol> ö<br>              ÷<br>              ø </font></td>            <td nowrap align=center> </td>        </table>      </td>  </table></center><p>Note that the change in surface elevation is linear in the change in crustal   thickness; that is, it is linear in f<sub>c</sub> &nbsp;z<sub>c0</sub>.
