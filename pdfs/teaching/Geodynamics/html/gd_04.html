A number of idealized   classes of constitutive relations are recognized. The principal material behaviours   are <i>elastic</i>, <i>plastic</i> and <i>viscous</i>. It should be noted that   the constitutive relations appropriate to these behaviours are idealized and   many materials show more complicated stress-strain relations. For example, a   special class of behaviour of relevance to geology is <i> visco-elasticity</i>   (and visco-plasticity). <p> <h2><a name="tth_sEc4.1"> 4.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;A rheological primer</h2><p> In simple, isotropic, elastic materials stress and strain are linearly related.   An important aspect of elasticity is that all strain is recovered on relaxation   of the stress. Plastic material shows an elastic response up to a critical stress,   termed the yield stress, at which the material fails. For perfectly plastic   behaviour the material cannot support stresses greater than the yield stress.   In viscous materials stresses and strain rates are related. Thus no deformation   is recovered with the relaxation of stresses. The general form of the constitutive   relation for viscous materials is : <a name="eq:viscosity"> </a> <center>  <table border=0 align=center>    <tr>      <td>         <table align=left>          <tr>            <td nowrap align=center> <font face=symbol>t</font> = k &nbsp;</td>            <td nowrap align=center> .<br>              <font face=symbol>g</font><br>              &nbsp;<br>            </td>            <td nowrap align=center> <font size="-1"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>n</sub></font>               <br>              <font size="-1"></font>&nbsp;<br>            </td>            <td nowrap> </td>        </table>      </td>      <td width=100 align=right>(4.1)</td>  </table>  <p align="left">where k and n are constants, and [(<font face=symbol>g</font>)\dot] is the shear strain rate.

The lack of internal deformation   of the ocean lithosphere reflects its strength; it must be strong enough to   sustain the stresses arising from these fundamental driving forces (that is,   the ocean lithosphere acts as a stress guide). The behaviour of the ocean lithosphere   contrasts with many parts of the continents wherein intense, diffuse, internal   deformation is manifested by the wide distribution of seismic events. The existence   of diffuse deformation within the continental interiors implies that the continental   lithosphere is, in general, considerably weaker than the oceanic lithosphere   (or that the magnitude of the stresses sustaining deformation of the continents   is larger than for oceans). In addition, differences in the behaviour of the   oceanic and continental lithosphere are governed by differences in their buoyancy.   Old oceanic lithosphere is negatively buoyant allowing eventual subduction and   the effective recycling of the oceanic lithosphere in the convective mantle;   one consequence is that there is no oceanic lithosphere older than about 200   Ma on the surface of the modern Earth. In contrast the continental lithosphere   is always positively buoyant and cannot be subducted to any significant extent;   consequently we have fragments of the continental lithosphere dating back to   about 3.9 Ga. <p> In later chapters we consider the deformation of the continental lithosphere   in both compression (which results in the development of mountain belts) and   in tension (which results in the development of rifts and the attendant sedimentary   basins and flanking uplifted margins). We will not be so much concerned with   the internal geometry of deformation (which is very much the realm of structural   geology) but the mechanical and thermal consequences of the deformation on the   lithospheric scale. Our aim is to develop an understanding of the controls on   some simple and regular, yet, as we shall see, fundamentally important features   of continental orogenic belts, for example, the <em>first-order</em> controls   on elevation. In order to understand the behaviour of the continents during   deformation we begin with some simple notions concerning the strength or rheology   of the continental lithosphere. <p> <p><a name="tth_fIg4.3"> </a> <a name="fig:rthree"> </a>   <center>    Figure 4.3: <font size="-3"> The stress needed to deform the lithosphere and     the failure mode depend upon the depth, the strain rate, the thermal structure     as well as the mineralogical composition of the deforming rocks. At shallow     depths (low confining pressures and low temperatures) failure occurs in the     brittle mode, at deeper levels (high confining pressures and high temperatures)     deformation occurs in a ductile fashion. The strength of rocks is strongly     dependent on the temperature and the strain rate. Curve 1 is appropriate to     low strain rates or high geotherms, while curve 2 is appropriate to lower     geotherms or higher strain rates. The brittle-ductile transition can be viewed     as the depth at which failure mode switches, and coincides approximately with     the base of the seismogenic zone. </font>  </center><p> <p> <h2><a name="tth_sEc4.3"> 4.3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;A model lithosphere</h2><p> The above discussion implies that the lithosphere has finite strength! That   is rocks are able to sustain a finite deviatoric stress (or stress difference)   by elastic deformation, all of which is recoverable on the relaxation of the   stress. At stress in excess of the critical deviatoric stress rocks will undergo   a permanent deformation by processes such as brittle fracture, dislocation creep,   pressure solution, the actual deformation mechanism depending on the temperature,   strain rate and composition of the rock. The finite elastic strength of the   lithosphere implies the general rheological response is plastic, and since the   response of the lithosphere can be shown in many cases to be time dependent   the lithosphere exhibits a complex form of visco-plasticity. The complete description   of the rheological behaviour of such a lithosphere represents a formidable challenge.   However it is possible to achieve the general form of a visco-plastic response   by specifying a lithospheric rheology governed by a combination of two simple   failure mechanisms, as described below. <p> <p><a name="tth_fIg4.4"> </a> <a name="fig:rfour"> </a>   <center>    Figure 4.4: <font size="-3">The strength of the lithosphere is given by the     area under the <font face=symbol>t</font> vs depth curves. The strength is a function primarily of the vertical compositional     structure of the lithosphere, the geotherm and the strain rate. (a) is appropriate     to a low geotherm or high strain rate, i.e. strong lithosphere, where the     strongest part of the lithosphere is the brittle upper mantle. (b) is appropriate     to a high geotherm or low strain rate (i.e., a weaker lithosphere) where there     is no brittle mantle. Note that the proportion of the total strength of the     lithosphere concentrated in the crust (especially near the brittle-ductile     transition) increases with increasing geotherm. </font>  </center><p> <p> Active seismicity in the continents is, by and large, restricted to depths   less than about 15 kms. Since seismic energy represents the release of elastic   energy at failure along a discrete fault plane, the lower limit of seismicity   can be thought of as the brittle-ductile transition.

Thus for a given composition,   strength must decrease with depth. </p><p> In terms of this rheology the brittle-ductile transition can therefore be   understood as the depth where the stress required for failure is equal for both   ductile creep and brittle failure (Figure <a href="#fig:rthree">4.2</a>). The   material constants for creep vary significantly with the mineralogical makeup   of the rock. For example, quartz-rich rocks are much weaker than olivine-bearing   rocks. Thus the strength of the lithosphere can be determined only for a specific   compositional structure (as well as thermal structure). To a first approximation   we can consider that the continental lithosphere comprises two layers: a quartz-rich   crustal layer and an olivine-rich mantle layer. For any arbitrary geotherm the   strength of such a hypothetical lithosphere depends only on the material constants   appropriate to quartz and olivine (Figure <a href="#fig:rfour">4.3</a>). Permanent   deformation of the whole lithosphere at given shear strain rate, [(<font face=symbol>g</font>)\dot], will only occur when the force applied to the lithosphere exceeds the   strength of the lithosphere, F<sub>l</sub>, given by (Figure <a href="#fig:rfive">4.3</a>b):   <a name="eq:strength"> </a> </p><center>  <table border=0 align=center>    <tr>      <td>         <table align=left>          <tr>            <td nowrap align=center> F<sub>l</sub> &nbsp; = &nbsp;</td>            <td align=left class="cl"><font face=symbol> ó<br>              õ </font></td>            <td nowrap align=center> <font size="-1">z<sub>l</sub></font> <br>              <br>              <font size="-1">0</font>&nbsp;<br>            </td>            <td nowrap> Ê(<font face=symbol>s</font><sub>1</sub> - <font face=symbol>s</font><sub>3</sub> ) &nbsp;dz </td>        </table>      </td>      <td width=100 align=right>(4.5)</td>  </table></center><p> For high strain rates, low geotherms or low applied forces much of the stress   in the lithosphere will be supported at least in part elastically (Figure <a href="#fig:rfive">4.3</a>a).   Because of the dependence on strain rate the behaviour of the lithosphere is   time dependent. On short time scales the lithosphere is able to support forces   in an elastic fashion; on longer timescales it will relieve the applied forces   by viscous, permanent deformation. The rheology of the lithosphere may therefore   be considered as visco-plastic. <p> <p><a name="tth_fIg4.5"> </a> <a name="fig:rfive"> </a>   <center>    Figure 4.5: <font size="-3"> The distribution of stress within the lithosphere     subject to a horizontal force (in compression or tension) depends on the magnitude     of the force, the strain rate and the geotherm (for a given composition).     An applied force, F<sub>d</sub>, will give instantaneously a homogeneous stress     distribution, <font face=symbol>s</font><sub>i</sub>, throughout the lithosphere such that <font face=symbol>s</font><sub>i</sub>&nbsp;z<sub>l</sub> = F<sub>d</sub> In those regions where <font face=symbol>s</font><sub>i</sub> exceeds the critical stress difference for permanent deformation     the stresses will be relaxed, with resultant amplification of the stress in     the stronger parts of the lithosphere.

Firstly, the lithosphere comprises polymineralic aggregates and   the extent to which the whole of the crust can be described by <em>quartz-failure</em>   and the mantle by <em> olivine-failure</em> is extremely dubious. The strength-depth   curve for more realistic compositional models of the lithosphere is likely to   be much more complex than shown in models shown in Figs <a href="#fig:rfour">4.3</a>   &amp; <a href="#fig:rfive">4.3</a>. Secondly, the material constants are determined   in laboratory experiments carried out at strain rates appropriate to human activity   (10<sup>-5</sup>-10<sup>-8</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>), as opposed to geological strain   rates (10<sup>-13</sup>-10<sup>-16</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>). This is particularly   important because only small changes in the value of the material constants   have a large effect on the calculated strength. Finally, the model excludes   a number of deformation mechanisms, such as pressure solution which are known   to be operative at least under some conditions. <p> Such uncertainties render futile the calculation of the absolute strength   of the lithosphere using this simplistic model. For example, a 10% uncertainty   in the activation energy for creep corresponds to an uncertainty in the strength   of the lithosphere of about a factor of 2. However, much more significance can   be attached to estimates of the changes in strength accompanying changes in   the physical state of the lithosphere using this model, because at least in   this case uncertainties in the material constants cancel. For example, a change   in the thermal regime of the lithosphere corresponding to a change in the Moho   temperature of 100<sup>o</sup>C causes a change in the strength of about a factor   of 2 (Fig. <a href="#rsix">4.4</a>). <p> <p><a name="tth_fIg4.6"> </a> <a name="rsix"> </a>   <center>    Figure 4.6: <font size="-3"> Illustration of the dependence of lithospheric     strength calculated using our simple rheological model on thermal state of     the lithosphere, as reflected by the Moho temperature. </font>  </center></body></html>
