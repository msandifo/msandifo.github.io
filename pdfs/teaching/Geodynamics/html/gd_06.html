The evolution of these reservoirs through time can be traced by   analysis of their radiogenic isotopic signatures. In this section we provide   the essential concepts needed to utilize radiogenic isotopes as a constraint   on the evolution of these reservoirs. Three decay schemes are used extensively   in the study of geodynamics: the Rb-Sr scheme, the Nd-Sm scheme and the U-Pb   scheme. <p> <h2><a name="tth_sEc6.1"> 6.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Geochemical reservoirs</h2><p> Why are there distinctive geochemical reservoirs? The differentiated state   of the present Earth is largely due to the formation and segregation of <i>partial   melts</i> in the interior of the planet. Because magmas are less dense than   the solid rocks in which they form, they naturally migrate towards regions of   lower pressure. The key process in the evolution of distinct geochemical reservoirs   formed due to the segregation of partial melts is the way in which elements   are partitioned between the melt and the residual solid. A simple model for   the variation in concentration of elements in magmas during partial melting   based on batch melting in which the melt stays in equilibrium with the solid   until the specified fusion proportion is: <a name="eq:shaw"> </a> <center>  <table border=0 align=center>    <tr>      <td>         <table align=left>          <tr>            <td nowrap align=center> </td>            <td nowrap align=center> C<sub>l</sub>              <hr NOSHADE>              C<sub>o</sub><br>            </td>            <td nowrap align=center> = </td>            <td nowrap align=center> 1              <hr NOSHADE>              F+D &nbsp;(1-F)<br>            </td>            <td nowrap align=center> </td>        </table>      </td>      <td width=100 align=right>(6.1)</td>  </table></center><p>where F is the fraction of fusion, C<sub>o</sub> is the concentration of the   element in the initial solid, C<sub>l</sub> is the concentration of the element   in the melt, D is the bulk distribution coefficient: </p><p> <a name="eq:distr"> </a> <center>  <table border=0 align=center>    <tr>      <td>         <table align=left>          <tr>            <td nowrap align=center> D = </td>            <td nowrap align=center> <font size="-1">n</font> <br>              <font face=symbol size="+3">å<br>              </font> <font size="-1">i = 1</font>&nbsp;<br>            </td>            <td nowrap> w<sub>i</sub> K<sub>D<sub>i</sub></sub> </td>        </table>      </td>      <td width=100 align=right>(6.2)</td>  </table></center><p>where </p><center>  <table border=0 align=center>    <tr>      <td>         <table align=left>          <tr>            <td nowrap align=center> K<sub>Di</sub> = </td>            <td nowrap align=center> X<sub>i</sub><sup>a</sup>              <hr NOSHADE>              X<sub>melt</sub><sup>a</sup><br>            </td>            <td nowrap align=center> </td>        </table>      </td>  </table></center><p>and where n is the number of mineral phases, w is the weight fraction of mineral   i, and X<sub>i</sub><sup>a</sup> is the concentration of element a in phase   i. The distribution coefficient of trace elements with respect to specific minerals   is a function of ionic charge and radius. Different minerals have different   affinities for individual trace elements and therefore different K<sub>D</sub>   values. The D values represent the effective <em>bulk distribution coefficient</em>   for the whole mineral assemblage coexisting with the melt. Trace elements that   have high D values are referred to as <i>compatible</i>, while those with D   &lt; 1 are referred to as <i>incompatible</i>. Note that what constitutes a   compatible or incompatible element depends on the specific mineral assemblage.   Thus, Sr is an incompatible element for mantle-melting involving olivine and   pyroxene assemblages whereas it is a compatible element during crustal melting   where feldspars are involved. The crust is the repository of trace elements   which are incompatible with respect to the mineralogy of the Earth's mantle. </p><p> Equation <a href="#eq:shaw">6.1</a> has a number of important special solutions   (Figure <a href="#shawplot">6.1</a>). If D = 1 then C<sub>l</sub>/C<sub>o</sub>   = 1 and there is no fractionation between source and magma. If D &gt;&gt; 1   then C<sub>l</sub>/C<sub>o</sub> &lt; 1 and the element is preferentially retained   in the unmelted residue. If D = 0 then C<sub>l</sub>/C<sub>o</sub> tends to   1/F and the trace element is strongly partitioned into the melt phase and its   enrichment is simply a function of the amount of melting. Figure <a href="#shawplot">6.1</a>   also illustrates the effect of extraction of partial melts on the relative concentration   of trace elements in the unmelted solid residue. Note that highly incompatible   elements are very quickly and efficiently extracted from the melting solid and   the residues of such melting are highly depleted in these elements. <p> <p><a name="tth_fIg6.1"> </a> <a name="shawplot"> </a>   <center>    Figure 6.1: <font size="-3">Solutions to Eqn 4.1 are shown as a function of     the proportion of fusion the degree of enrichment or depletion relative to     their source (C<sub>o</sub>), of incompatible and compatible trace elements     whose bulk distribution coefficients range from zero to ten. </font>  </center><p> <p> The solution to Eqn <a href="#eq:shaw">6.1</a> for varying amounts of melting   of two trace elements both of which have D &lt; 1 but for which D<sub>E<sub>1</sub></sub>   ( = 0.01) &lt; D<sub>E<sub>2</sub></sub> ( = 0.8) where both elements have C<sub>o</sub>   = 5ppm is shown in Figure <a href="#frac">6.1</a>, Figure <a href="#comp">6.1</a>   illustrates the variation of the ratio (E<sub>1</sub>/E<sub>2</sub>)<sub>liquid</sub>   as a function of F.

However, as discussed   in the previous section, partial melts of rocks only reflect the composition   of those source rocks indirectly. By contrast, it is assumed that at the time   of melting, the isotopic compositions of the liquid and it's source rocks are   the same and thus the initial isotopic compositions of magmas are the same as   those of their source regions at the time of melting. <p> Naturally occurring radioactive isotopes decay spontaneously to yield stable   daughter isotopes.

The importance of this is considerable not only for the   determination of specific rock ages, but also because it provides a connection   between the chemistry of specific regions of the earth and their radiogenic   isotopic compositions. As discussed in Section 4.1 the changes in concentration   of trace elements in both extracted melts and in residues during fusion depends   on the D value. Because parent and daughter elements will have different D values   partial melting will produce melts and residues whose parent to daughter ratios   are different from the source. For instance in general D<sub>Rb</sub> &lt; D<sub>Sr</sub>   and D<sub>Sm</sub> &gt; D<sub>Nd</sub>. Therefore melts have higher Rb/Sr and   lower Sm/Nd ratios than their sources. Figure <a href="#rbehav">6.3</a>a illustrates   the general process of the production of a new separate reservoir, M, by melting   and melt extraction of a source, S, at time, TD, leaving a slightly modified   source region, R. This specific example is true for a situation in which the   parent isotope is more incompatible than the daughter (as is the case for Rb   - Sr). If the opposite were true (as in the case of Sm-Nd), the extracted melt   trajectory would be less steep than that of the residue. Figures <a href="#rbehav">6.3</a>b   and c illustrate two other petrogenetic processes which are also relevant. Of   particular importance is isotopic homogenisation which will occur by diffusion   during geologically meaningful timescales at temperatures above the so-called   blocking temperature. It is an important observation that even at temperatures   above the blocking temperature, the rate of diffusional equilibration between   adjacent solids or non-convective, non-mixing liquids is only of the order of   a meter in 10<sup>7</sup> years. For this reason the establishment of large   separate geochemical reservoirs like the crust or asthenospheric upper mantle,   requires both large scale melt extraction and convective heat and mass transfer. </p><p> <p><a name="tth_fIg6.4"> </a> <a name="rbehav"> </a>   <center>    Figure 6.4: <font size="-3"> Generalized model for three broad types of temporal     control on rock radiogenic isotopic composition. a) differentiation by partial     melting, S = source, m = melt, TD = time of melting. b) mixing of two compositionally     and isotopically distinct melts at time TM to form a homogeneous hybrid. c)     Solid-state isotopic homogenisation of two adjacent rocks masses or minerals,     A and B, due to metamorphism. </font>  </center><p> <p> <h2><a name="tth_sEc6.4"> 6.4</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;The chondritic earth</h2><p> An important process in the chemical differentiation of the earth from an   initial compositionally homogeneous globe has been the generation and segregation   of partial melts to form several new separated reservoirs (crust, asthenosphere   etc). A comprehensive geodynamic model of the earth requires knowledge of the   age, life-span and source of these separate regions. <p> Because the earth has undergone continuous differentiation since its formation   at about 4.55 x 10<sup>9</sup> years ago it is not a simple problem to determine   what the bulk composition of the whole, undifferentiated planet was. We only   have easy access to the outer crustal portions of the earth and the entire crust   only represents a small proportion of the earth's total mass. As we have already   seen, this part of the earth has an unrepresentative enrichment of those elements   whose distribution coefficients with respect to the mantle minerals are very   low. For instance approximately 70% of the earth's entire supply of K, Rb and   Cs all now reside in the crust. <p> By contrast, the Moon which is a considerably smaller planetary body, has   undergone much less differentiation than has the earth. It's crust is much more   like what we suppose it's whole composition to be and the oldest dates obtained   from Moon rocks are much closer to 4.55 Ga. than the oldest terrestrial dates   (Amitsoq Gneiss from S.W. Greenland dated at 3.9 Ga.). This illustrates that   some form of crustal re-cycling on earth has destroyed most of the original   crust, activity absent from the Moon since the earliest Proterozoic. Meteorites   are pieces of a fragmented planetary body (probably more than one) which probably   occupied an orbit between earth and Mars. Like the Moon, this appears to have   had only a short history of geological activity and was then broken-up to form   the asteroid belt. Meteorites therefore represent a unique opportunity to directly   examine and analyze samples from the interior of a terrestrial planet like earth.   They fall into three groups: <ul>  <li> Metallic Iron-Nickel alloy meteorites; fragments of the core of an earth-like     planet.   <li> Stoney meteorites; these are mainly silicate-rich composed of olivine and     pyroxenes and are derived from the equivalent of the earth's mantle.   <li> Chondritic meteorites; a unique class of meteorites which have had no high     temperature history. They are carbon-rich and often contain significant concentrations     of volatile compounds. </ul><p>The stoney meteorites provide mineral isochrons in both the Rb-Sr and Sm-Nd   systems (O'Nions et al, 1979) that indicate the age of the terrestrial planets   to be 4.5 -4.55 Ga. and indicate initial <sup>87</sup>Rb / <sup>86</sup>Sr and   <sup>143</sup>Nd / <sup>144</sup>Nd ratios to be 0.69898 and 0.50682, respectively. </p><p> The chondritic meteorites have not been part of a planet that has differentiated   core and mantle and their bulk composition is thought to be very similar to   the inter-stellar dust from which the planets accreted. The first approximation   of the whole-earth's composition is therefore the composition of the chondritic   class of meteorites and it is informative to present data on terrestrial samples   normalized relative to this as illustrated by Figure <a href="#chond">6.4</a>. <p> <p><a name="tth_fIg6.5"> </a> <a name="chond"> </a>   <center>    Figure 6.5: <font size="-3">The dashed line represents the normalized rare     earth content of of a chondritic source and the normalized compositions of     melts due to 1 and 15% partial fusion are shown. The residue in equilibrium     with the 15% melt is the lower most curve.</font>  </center><p> <p> Given that we are able to define the initial Nd and Sr isotopic composition   and age of the Earth and we can use the composition of chondritic meteorites   to define its Rb/Sr and Sm/Nd ratios, we are now in a position to predict the   variation in the <sup>87</sup>Rb / <sup>86</sup>Sr and <sup>143</sup>Nd / <sup>144</sup>Nd   ratios for this chondritic uniform reservoir (CHUR) as a function of time (McCulloch   and Wasserburg, 1978). The "mantle" lines in the the two lower diagrams in Figure   <a href="#res">6.4</a> are a representation of this reservoir. <p> It is very common that the Sr and Nd isotopic compositions of rocks are not   quoted directly as ratios but are compared to the expected values of the chondritic   reservoir.

If this rock is not of zero age and if the age is known, then   its initial isotopic composition at its age, T, can be calculated and compared   to the chondritic reservoir at that time, <font face=symbol>e</font><sub>Nd</sub>(T) and <font face=symbol>e</font><sub>Sr</sub>(T). In the upper diagram of Figure <a href="#res">6.4</a>, the   axes could equally be presented as isotope ratio values or <font face=symbol>e</font> values. The "bulk earth" position in this diagram is the intersection point   of <font face=symbol>e</font><sub>Nd</sub>(0) = 0 and <font face=symbol>e</font><sub>Sr</sub>(0) = 0. This figure shows the field modern day ocean island basalts   (OIB) and mid ocean ridge basalt (MORB). These reflect the composition of the   present day mantle and show that though some ocean island magmatism is sampling   mantle whose composition is close to the predicted chondritic Earth, the modern   mantle shows some very strong deviation from this model. This is particularly   so for those portions of the mantle sampled by the voluminous magmatic production   at the mid ocean ridges. On this same diagram from Figure <a href="#res">6.4</a>,   the field of continental crust is also shown. This has high <sup>87</sup>Rb   / <sup>86</sup>Sr (or positive <font face=symbol>e</font><sub>Sr</sub>) values and low <sup>143</sup>Nd / <sup>144</sup>Nd (or negative   <font face=symbol>e</font><sub>Nd</sub>) values. As the range of Sm/Nd ratios of continental rocks is relatively   limited, Eqn <a href="#eq:eps">6.8</a> reduces to express <sup>143</sup>Nd /   <sup>144</sup>Nd as a function of time and this is illustrated as the age contours   in the continental crustal quadrant in Figure <a href="#res">6.4</a>. Note that   this is not so for <sup>87</sup>Rb / <sup>86</sup>Sr as there is a very large   range of Rb/Sr values for common crustal rocks. </p><p> <p><a name="tth_fIg6.6"> </a> <a name="res"> </a>   <center>    Figure 6.6: <font size="-3"> Upper: Present day Nd - Sr isotopic covariations     for important terrestrial reservoirs. MORB is mid ocean ridge basalts, OIB     is ocean island basalts. Lower: Sr- and Nd-time evolutionary diagrams. T<sub>     model</sub> is a model age. Data for the ocean island basalts suggests that     in addition to the depleted domain there still exists a mantle reservoir that     has not suffered relative Rb and Nd depletion. There is some suggestion that     this is a lower mantle or lower upper mantle reservoir which still has a chondrite-like     chemistry. This region is also a probable source of rare gas emissions including     the now extinct <sup>129</sup>Xe suggestive of long term isolation without     melt extraction. If this were true it would have important implications in     constraining the extent and dimensions of mantle convective cells.</font>  </center><p> <p> <h2><a name="tth_sEc6.5"> 6.5</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;The depleted mantle</h2><p> Figure <a href="#chond">6.4</a> shows that for the partial fusion of a chondritic   source like that assumed to represent the undifferentiated earth, the degree   of total rare earth element enrichment in the melt diminishes with larger amounts   of melting and that the residual source is depleted in these incompatible elements.   More importantly, the melts have lower Sm/Nd ratios than the original pristine   source and the residue has a higher Sm/Nd ratio. <p> To a simplified first approximation (with respect to the rare earth elements),   Figure <a href="#chond">6.4</a> illustrates the evolution of the two important   terrestrial geochemical reservoirs: <ul>  <li> a melt repository (= crust) and,   <li> a source region depleted in the crust forming elements by crustal extraction     (= some part of the present mantle). </ul><p>The lower two diagrams in Figure <a href="#res">6.4</a> show the present day   range of Nd and Sr isotopic compositions of the continental crust with respect   to a mantle reservoir. These represent simplifications of the true situation,   because (Figure <a href="#chond">6.4</a>) the extraction of melts from the mantle   bring about complimentary changes to the composition of that mantle. A mantle   region that has suffered partial melting and melt extraction will have higher   Sm/Nd and lower Rb/Sr and U/Pb ratios than the original chondritic unmelted   mantle. </p><p> Mid-ocean ridge basalts are melts of the contemporary decompressed asthenospheric   mantle beneath the oceanic ridges. Even though these are melts they have rare   earth patterns which are like the solid residue in Figure <a href="#chond">6.4</a>   and are strongly LREE-depleted. This suggests they are the products of remelting   of mantle that has already lost a melt component before. In Figure <a href="#res">6.4</a>,   the MORB field is at high <font face=symbol>e</font><sub>Nd</sub> and low <font face=symbol>e</font><sub>Sr</sub> confirming that their source mantle had achieved its depleted chemistry   over a long period of geological time (perhaps 2 Ga). We then view the continents   as being complimentary to the depleted mantle now being sampled by mid ocean   ridge magmatism.
