The volcanic   rocks extruded at the surface of the ridges are exclusively basalt (mid-ocean   ridge basalt or MORB) which, together with there sub-volcanic intrusive equivalents   - gabbros and sheeted dykes, comprise the entire oceanic crust. The total thickness   of the oceanic crust generated by mafic igneous activity at the ridges is typically   about 5-7 km. The structure of oceanic crust and parts of the subcrustal lithosphere   can be directly observed in some ancient orogenic belts where fragments of the   oceanic lithosphere have been obducted to form <em>ophiolites</em> during collision   processes, for example the Semail ophiolite in Oman. <p> <p><a name="tth_fIg7.1"> </a> <a name="oceanlith"> </a>   <center>    Figure 7.1: <font size="-3">Schematic structure of the ocean lithosphere.     The ocean lithosphere consists of about 6-7 km thick crust (heavy stiple),     and the mantle lithosphere (intermediate stiple) which thickens with age (and     hence distance away from the ridge as indicated by arrows). Light stiple show     the region of decompression melting beneath the ridge. Stream lines in the     asthenosphere may be largely decoupled from the motion of the overlying lithosphere     (see Section 5.5), although asthenosphere must undergo decompression immediately     beneath the ridge.</font>  </center><p> <p> <h2><a name="tth_sEc7.1"> 7.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Age, bathymetry and heatflow</h2><p>In ocean lithosphere younger than about 80 Ma there is a remarkable correspondence   between age of the ocean crust, the depth to the sea floor (bathymetry) and   the heat flow through the lithosphere (Fig. <a href="#oceanlith">7</a>); with   bathymetric depth increasing, and surface heatflow decreasing, with the <font face=symbol>Ö</font>[Êage].   This correspondence between age, bathymetry and heatflow is due to time dependent   changes in the thickness of the lithosphere. Two models for the ocean lithosphere   have been proposed in order to account for this relation: the <i>half-space   model</i> and the <i>thermal plate model</i>. </p><p> <h4>The half-space model</h4><p>The cooling of ocean lithosphere after formation at a ridge can be treated   as a thermal conduction problem (see Chapter 3) in which a non-steady state   condition (the situation at the ridge) gradually decays towards a thermally   equilibrated state (as the ocean lithOSphere slides away from the ridge). The   analogy (Fig <a href="#half">7.1</a>a) can be made with the cooling of a semi-infinite   half space, which is given by: <a name="eq:halfs"> </a> </p><center>  <table border=0 align=center>    <tr>      <td>         <table align=left>          <tr>            <td nowrap align=center> </td>            <td nowrap align=center> T<sub>z</sub>Ê-ÊT<sub>m</sub>              <hr NOSHADE>              T<sub>s</sub>Ê-ÊT<sub>m</sub><br>            </td>            <td nowrap align=center> = erfc</td>            <td align=left class="cl"><font face=symbol> æ<br>              ç<br>              ç<br>              ç<br>              è </font></td>            <td nowrap align=center> z              <hr NOSHADE>              <table border=0>                <tr>                  <td nowrap align=center> 2&nbsp;</td>                  <td align=left class="cl"><font face=symbol size="+2">Ö</font></td>                  <td nowrap align=center>                     <hr NOSHADE>                    <font face=symbol>k</font>&nbsp;t<br>                    &nbsp;<br>                  </td>                  <td nowrap align=center> </td>              </table>            </td>            <td align=left class="cl"><font face=symbol> ö<br>              ÷<br>              ÷<br>              ÷<br>              ø </font></td>            <td nowrap align=center> </td>        </table>      </td>      <td width=100 align=right>(7.1)</td>  </table></center><p>where T<sub>z</sub> is the temperature at depth z, T<sub>s</sub> is the temperature   at the surface interface of the semi-infinite half space (which in this case   is the temperature of ocean water and is taken to be 0<sup>o</sup>C), T<sub>m</sub>   is the temperature of the half space in the initial condition and which is maintained   at infinite distance for all time (in our case the temperature of the deep mantle,   1280<sup>o</sup>C), <font face=symbol>k</font> is the thermal diffusivity and t is time (the error function, erf, and its compliment,   erfc, arise commonly in analytical solutions to the heat equation and related   differential equations which employ similarity variables). </p><p> The behaviour of the error function, and hence Eqn <a href="#eq:halfs">7.1</a>,   is illustrated in Figure <a href="#half">7.1</a>b.

Given a constant   volume of sea water, a change in the average age and hence depth of the oceans   must result in a change in sea level, which is reflected in the geological record   by the extent of ocean onlap on the continents. The average age of the oceans   is inversely proportional to the rate of sea floor spreading, and directly proportional   to the square root of the mean age of subduction.

Indeed, this explanation has been used to account for high ocean stands during the Cretaceous (when sea level may have been up to 300 m higher than today) which correspond with periods of fast ocean floor spreading (as indicated by analysis of ocean floor magnetic anomalies). <p> <h4>The thermal plate model</h4><p>The semi-inifinite half space model predicts continuous cooling (albeit at   a rate that gradually decays with time) and therefore thickening of the lithosphere   through time (Figure <a href="#model">7.1</a>). While the predictions are in   remarkable agreement with the observations on bathymetry and heat flow in young   ocean lithosphere these relationships appear to break down in ocean lithosphere   older than about 80 Ma, when the thermal structure of the oceanic lithosphere   appears to be stabilised. </p><p> <p><a name="tth_fIg7.3"> </a> <a name="model"> </a>   <center>    Figure 7.3: <font size="-3">Thermal structure of the ocean lithosphere predicted     by the semi-infinite half space model (a) and by the thermal plate model (b).</font>  </center><p> <p> The semi-infinite half space model assumes that the half space is not convecting.   In the earth the deep mantle is convecting, with the consequence that a convective   heat flux is provided at the top of the convecting layer (see Chapter 7). The   thermal plate model accounts for this apparent time independent behaviour of   old oceanic lithosphere by assuming that the convection in the subjacent mantle   provides sufficient heat to the base of the cooling lithosphere to stabilise   the cooling once a critical thickness is reached, the observations suggest this   critical thickness is about 125 km corresponding to the thickness of &nbsp;80   Ma old lithosphere (Figure <a href="#model">7.1</a>b). Simply stated, the oceanic   plate structure is thermally stabilised when the convective heat supply to the   base of the lithosphere balances heat lost through the lithosphere. <p> <h2><a name="tth_sEc7.2"> 7.2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Force balance on the ocean ridge</h2><p>For young ocean lithosphere the cooling of a semi infinite half space provides   an acceptable approximation and therefore Eqns <a href="#eq:halfs">7.1</a> -   <a href="#eq:water">7.3</a> can be used as the basis to calculate the force   balance on the ocean ridge. The isostatic compensation of the oceanic lithosphere   causes the youngest ocean to form a high, albeit submerged, mountain range standing   out above the abyssal plains. Such profound topographic gradients necessarily   lead to substantial horizontal buoyancy forces (Chapter 2), termed the ridge   push. In this section we provide the methodology for calculating the magnitude   of the ridge push. </p><p><a name="tth_fIg7.4"> </a> <p> <a name="ocean"> </a>   <center>    Figure 7.4: <font size="-3">Ridge push is the force resulting from isostatically     induced topographic gradients in the oceanic lithosphere.

The ridge push effectively   maintains the constant rupturing of the oceanic lithosphere, and its separation   on either side of the ridges. An important result of this rupture of the lithosphere   at the ridges relates to the decompression of the underlying asthenosphere. <p> <p><a name="tth_fIg7.7"> </a> <a name="melt"> </a>   <center>    Figure 7.7: <font size="-3">P-T diagram showing melting field of garnet peridotite     and adiabatic (isentropic) decompression paths for mantle with potential temperatures     of 1280<sup>o</sup>C, 1380<sup>o</sup>C, 1480<sup>o</sup>C and 1580<sup>o</sup>C,     respectively (after McKenzie and Bickle, 1988).</font>  </center><p> <p> The decompression of asthenosphere beneath spreading ridges is so rapid that   there is virtually no loss of heat per unit rock mass; the decompression is   therefore isentropic.

This adiabatic gradient   is about 1<sup>o</sup>C/km in the solid mantle. If the system becomes partly   molten, then the change in volume with pressure is larger and T changes more   quickly. Since the temperature of the convective mantle is not constant but   lies on an adiabat we characterise it by its potential temperature (T<sub>m</sub>),   which is the projected of the adiabat to the surface of the earth (i.e., at   1 atm). </p><p> If sufficient decompression occurs, melting of the asthenosphere will take   place when the adiabat passes through its solidus (Figure <a href="#melt">7.3</a>   and <a href="#amount">7.3</a>). The melt generated by this decompression has   the composition of MORB and provides the parental liquid for all igneous rocks   that make up the oceanic crust. <p> The amount of melting generated due to decompression of asthenospheric mantle   beneath an active ridge segment depends entirely on the thermal structure of   the asthenosphere and the melting properties of the mantle as a function of   pressure. For the present day thermal structure (T<sub>m</sub> = 1280<sup>o</sup>C)   the amount of melting during complete decompression, amounts to a vertical column   some 7 km thick (Figure <a href="#amount">7.3</a>). In the past, when the internal   temperature may have been considerably hotter than it is today, the column of   melt generated beneath the ridges, and hence the oceanic crust, may have been   significantly thicker than 7 km. <p> <p><a name="tth_fIg7.8"> </a> <a name="amount"> </a>   <center>    Figure 7.8: <font size="-3"> Thickness of melt (measured as a vertical column     in kms) present below the given indicated depth produced by the adiabatic     decompression of garnet peridotite for different potential temperatures (after     McKenzie and Bickle, 1988).

Indeed, this remarkable agreement between observations and   the age-heatflow-bathymetry relationships predicted by Eqns <a href="#eq:halfs">7.1</a>   - <a href="#eq:water">7.3</a> provides one of the principal lynchpins of the   plate tectonic paradigm and one of the most persuasive lines of argument that   the lithosphere is indeed thermally stabilised. Morover, it suggests that the   motion of the oceanic lithosphere is largely decoupled from the flow in the   underlying asthenosphere. There is as yet no clear understanding of the location,   or even the general planform of mantle upwelling in the asthenosphere. Most   importantly, we have shown that there is no requirement that the ocean ridges   represent the site of upwelling (Figure <a href="#oceanlith">7</a>). Wherever   asthenospheric upwelling occurs it is likely to modify the thermal structure   of the overlying lithosphere, and the suggestion is that the thermal structure   of most old oceanic lithosphere has been modified to some degree by upwelling   from within the underlying mantle. <p> <h2><a name="tth_sEc7.5"> 7.5</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Oceanic basalt chemistry</h2><p>The oceanic lithosphere is generated entirely by magmatic processes, most of   these concentrated at the mid ocean ridges, but with small, but scientifically   interesting additions at intraplate hot spots forming the ocean island and sea   mount chains (eg Hawaii, the Azores, Reunion, Iceland etc). Seafloor spreading   generates about 20 km<sup>3</sup>a<sup>-1</sup> of Mid Ocean Ridge Basalt (MORB)   by the decompressional fusion mechanism described above (Figures <a href="#geotherm">7.2</a>-<a href="#amount">7.3</a>),   making these by far the most important volcanic provinces on Earth. From the   perspective of this course we are most interested to know what oceanic magmatism   tells us about the chemistry and &#228;ges" of their mantle source regions. </p><p> With respect to important trace element concentrations and the abundance of   radiogenic isotopes, the basaltic rocks of the ocean islands (OIB) differ quite   significantly from MORB. As oceanic magmatism must be sampling the sub-lithospheric   mantle this immediately indicates that there are chemically distinct regions   of the oceanic asthenosphere and the differences in Nd, Sr and Pb isotopic compositions   (see Figure <a href="#oiso">7.5</a>) are such that these separate regions must   have remained isolated for timescales of the order of 2 Ga or more. This in   turn places limits on the type of mantle dynamics and convection that must have   occured. <p> As discussed in the previous chapter, MORB has the Sr, Nd (and Pb) isotopic   characteristics, as well as incompatible trace element chemistry, consistent   with derivation from a source which underwent the extraction of significant   fractions of melt at some period in the past. Broadly speaking the extent of   depletion of Rb, U and Nd in the oceanic upper asthenosphere as reflected by   present-day MORB is consistent with being the compliment of the continental   crust. Clearly, continental crust is not being produced at the present mid oceanic   ridges and for the lithophile elements to find their way from the sub-oceanic   mantle to the continents we must invoke at least a two-stage process. This second   stage process may involve subduction and arc formation. Alternatively, it is   possible that the main continental growth occurred in the Precambrian and was   unrelated to the Earth's present geodynamic mode. <p> <p><a name="tth_fIg7.9"> </a> <a name="oiso"> </a>   <center>    Figure 7.9: <font size="-3">The range of radiogenic isotopic compositions     (Nd, Sr, Pb and He) of oceanic basalts.

These elements are of course strongly concentrated in the Earth's   atmosphere. Perhaps surprisingly however, recent careful measurements of gasses   emmitted during volcanic eruptions, included in fresh volcanic rocks (glasses)   and even produced from hot springs and wells in continental and oceanic regions,   reveal that detectible amounts of these and other gasses are still being released   from the earth's interior. Furthermore these often show significant isotopic   differences from the atmospheric reservoir indicating that emissions are tapping   source regions which have been isolated for significant portions of the Earth's   history. <sup>40</sup>Ar is the radiogenic product of the decay of <sup>40</sup>K   and <sup>36</sup>Ar is a stable isotope. <sup>4</sup>He is the product of various   decay series of U and Th and <sup>3</sup>He is a stable isotope. The atmosphere   has extremely high ratios of <sup>4</sup>He/<sup>3</sup>He (722,000) and <sup>40</sup>Ar/<sup>36</sup>Ar   (295) because it is dominated by the accumulation of these products of radioactive   decay of lithophile elements. </p><p> MORB has high <sup>4</sup>He/<sup>3</sup>He ratios, though values are lower   than those of the atmosphere, and extremely high <sup>40</sup>Ar/<sup>36</sup>Ar.   This is interpreted to indicate that the source region of MORB was effectively   purged of most of its rare gas content early in the earth's history and that   most of the He and in particular, the Ar there now is derived from subsequent   U-Th and K decay. The existence of significant <sup>3</sup>He does however indicate   that the early degassing of the earth's interior (probably during core formation   soon after accretion) was not total and that some primitive reservoir in the   mantle has survived. This conclusion is supported by the <sup>129</sup>Xe results   which show that oceanic sources (OIB and MORB) are still producing this isotope.   <sup>129</sup>Xe is the product of the decay of <sup>129</sup>I which has a   half life of only 16 x 10<sup>6</sup> years and this decay scheme therefore   became extinct very early in the earth's history. By contrast with MORB, some   OIB have very low <sup>4</sup>He/<sup>3</sup>He and <sup>40</sup>Ar/<sup>36</sup>Ar   ratios, reflecting that a component of their source region is primitive and   had not undergone early degassing and melt extraction. </body></html>
