The gravitational body force exerted on material of unit volume in this   field is given by the product of its density and the acceleration due to gravity   (which is function of the mass distribution in the Earth). The way mass is distributed   in the lithosphere is central to the notion of <em>isostatic compensation</em>   and the consequences of gravity acting on the mass distribution in isostatically   compensated lithosphere is central to all of geodynamics. <p> <h2><a name="tth_sEc3.1"> 3.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Isostasy</h2><p> It has long been recognized that the surface elevation of the continents is   in some way related to the density distribution in the subsurface. The gravity   field at the surface of the earth reflects the distribution of mass at depth   and gravity measurements across mountain belts show that regions of high elevation   generally have a deficiency of mass at depth. That is, there is some specific   depth beneath the mountain range where the rocks have a lower density compared   with rocks at the same depth beneath the low lying regions flanking the mountain   range. The gravity field shows that the deficiency of mass at depth is, to a   first approximation, equal to the excess mass in the mountains, implying that   at some great depth within the earth, termed the depth of <i>isostatic compensation</i>,   the mass of the overlaying rock is equal and independent of the surface elevation.   From the gravity data alone, it is not possible to determine exactly how the   density is distributed in order to compensate the topography, and two rival   isostatic models have been proposed, referred to as Pratt Isostasy and Airy   Isostasy (Figure <a href="#isostasy">3.1</a>). These models were proposed long   before the concept of the lithosphere was formalized and in the original formulation   both models considered that isostatic compensation was achieved entirely within   the crust. <p> <p><a name="tth_fIg3.1"> </a> <a name="isostasy"> </a>   <center>    Figure 3.1: <font size="-3"> Pratt (a) and Airy (b) isostasy assume rather     different subsurface density distributions to compensate the excess mass associated     with the additional topography in mountains. Density distribution is proportional     to stipling. Seismic studies beneath mountains such as the Himalayas show     that the density structure approaches that of Airy Isostasy, although it is     now assumed that isostatic compensation occurs beneath the lithosphere and     not at the Moho.</font>  </center><p> <p> While modern seismic methods have shown that the structure of mountain ranges   closely approximates the Airy model, it is important to dispel the notion that   compensation is generally achieved at the bottom of the crust. The logical place   for compensation to take place is beneath the lithosphere, and in this course   we will initially assume, and then attempt to demonstrate, that this is the   general case. Indeed the very existence of large lateral temperature gradients   in the oceanic mantle lithosphere leads to significant horizontal density gradients.   These thermally induced density changes lead to corresponding changes in the   surface elevation of the oceanic lithosphere, through a kind of thermal isostasy.   The horizontal force resulting from the ocean floor topography, termed <em>ridge   push</em>, provides one of the fundamental driving forces for the motion and   deformation of the lithosphere. Isostatic compensation can be achieved because   the lithosphere essentially <i>floats</i> on a relatively <i>inviscid</i> substrate:   the weak peridotite of the asthenosphere. Changes in the buoyancy or elevation   of the lithosphere are accommodated by displacement of asthenospheric mantle.   However, asthenospheric mantle is not completely inviscid (that is, its viscosity   is not negligible), and its displacement in response to lithospheric loading   or unloading must take a finite length of time, related to its effective viscosity.   An insight into the timescales for the isostatic response of the asthenosphere   to loads is provided by the rebound of continental lithosphere following the   removal of glacial icecaps. The rebound following the removal of the Pleistocene   Laurentide icecap shows that the time scales appropriate to this isostatic response   are of the order of 10<sup>4</sup>-10<sup>5</sup> years. Since mountain belts   are built and decay on the time scale of 10<sup>7</sup>-10<sup>8</sup> years,   the isostatic response is effectively instantaneous. <p> <h2><a name="tth_sEc3.2"> 3.2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;The flexural strength of the lithosphere</h2><p> An important question concerning isostasy is the horizontal length scale on   which isostatic compensation is achieved. Gravity measurements across mountain   belts suggest that, on the scale of several hundred kilometers, the lithosphere   often approaches isostatic equilibrium. However the same measurements show that   the mass excess associated with small-scale topography, for example, individual   mountain peaks within mountain ranges, is generally not compensated. The length-scale   of isostatic equilibrium (viz., regional versus local isostatic compensation)   relates to the strength of the lithosphere: on small length-scales departures   from isostatic equilibrium are supported by the flexural (or elastic) strength   of the lithosphere. We illustrate the interaction between the flexural strength   of the lithosphere and the horizontal length scale of isostatic compensation   by considering a hypothetical infinitely strong lithosphere floating on a completely   inviscid substrate. Subject to a substantial, localized load such as a mountain   range, such a hypothetical lithosphere will be depressed such that the mass   of the displaced asthenosphere is equivalent to the mass of the load. In this   case the mass of the mountains is compensated over the regional horizontal dimension   of the lithosphere. Of course gravity shows us that this is not the case for   the earth, because the density distribution beneath mountains somehow compensates   the excess mass of the mountains on a length-scale of comparable dimension to   the mountains (Figure <a href="#flexure">3.2</a>b). However, on the smaller   length scale of individual mountain peaks compensation is not achieved; that   is the lithosphere is sufficiently strong to distribute the load of an individual   mountain over a length scale which is large compared to the lateral dimension   of the individual mountain. <p> <p><a name="tth_fIg3.2"> </a> <a name="flexure"> </a>   <center>    Figure 3.2: <font size="-3"> The response of the lithosphere (a) to applied     loads depends on its flexural strength (or rigidity). An infinitely strong     lithosphere compensates loads regionally over the lateral dimension of the     whole lithosphere (b). At the other end of the spectrum compensation may occur     completely beneath the load, so called local isostatic compensation (d). The     behaviour of the lithosphere, which has some finite flexural strength, lies     somewhere between these two extremes (c), implying that this flexural response     of the lithosphere is an important component of deformation associaed with     loading. For a visco-elastic lithosphere in which the response to loading     is time dependent these figures illustrate schematically the expected temporal     evolution following loading as the elastic response gives way to a viscous     response through time. </font>  </center><p> <p> As we shall see, the lithosphere has a finite flexural strength, in as much   as it can support a limited amount of loading without permanent deformation.   The effective flexural strength of the lithosphere is characterized by the thickness   of the elastic lithosphere, which in turn is dependent on the thermal and compositional   structure of the lithosphere. Importantly the flexural response of the lithosphere   to an applied load may be time dependent (as would be expected for a visco-elastic   material); after the emplacement of a load, the effective elastic thickness   of the lithosphere may decay with time as the elastic stresses are relieved   by permanent deformation. <p> <h2><a name="tth_sEc3.3"> 3.3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Gravitational potential energy </h2><i>Isostasy is a vertical stress balance!</i> Local isostasy requires that at the level of isostatic compensation the mass of overlaying rock is equalized, independently of the density distribution above this level.

These forces can be sustained because   rocks have finite strength <em>just as an immature brie does</em>. An understanding   of the rheology of rocks, that is the way in which they respond to applied forces,   is fundamental to developing quantitative tectonic models. <p> Gravity acts on mass and as mass is distributed throughout the volume of a   body the forces resulting from the action of gravity are termed <i>body forces</i>   (other types of body forces such as magnetic forces are largely irrelevant in   tectonics). As we have seen in the previous section the effect of gravitational   body forces acting on two columns with different density distributions produces   forces acting on the surface between the two columns. Such <i>surface forces</i>   are dependent on the area the orientation of the surface. Since the sum of the   forces acting on a body are equal to the mass times acceleration (Newton's second   law) it is relatively simple to derive the equations of motion, relating displacements   and forces (see Appendix A.1). The equations of motion are necessarily couched   in terms of the components of the stresses (or, more correctly, the stress tensor)   and therefore they must be rendered useful through combination with equations   relating stresses to displacements. Such equations, termed <i>constitutive equations</i>,   are material dependent and their study is the stuff of <i>rheology</i>. <p> <h2><a name="tth_sEc3.4"> 3.4</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Lithospheric potential energy and   geoid anomalies</h2>The contributions of lateral variations in the density structure of the lithospheric to observed geoid anomalies can be directly related to the dipole moment of the density distribution: <center>  <table border=0 align=center>    <tr>      <td>         <table align=left>          <tr>            <td nowrap align=center> <font face=symbol>D</font>N = - </td>            <td nowrap align=center> 2 &nbsp;<font face=symbol>p</font>&nbsp;G              <hr NOSHADE>              g<br>            </td>            <td nowrap align=center> </td>            <td align=left class="cl"><font face=symbol> ó<br>              õ </font></td>            <td nowrap align=center> <font size="-1">h</font> <br>              <br>              <font size="-1">0</font>&nbsp;<br>            </td>            <td nowrap> &nbsp;(<font face=symbol>D</font><font face=symbol>r</font>&nbsp;z )&nbsp;dz</td>        </table>      </td>      <td width=100 align=right>(3.5)</td>  </table></center>where <font face=symbol>D</font>N is the geoid anomaly in metres.
