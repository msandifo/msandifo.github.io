Similarly, potential energy   variations associated with continental topography are capable of generating   large buoyancy forces. In addition, the passage of the lithosphere over the   deeper, hotter convective mantle, or, viceversa, the traction exerted by the   convective flow on the base of the lithosphere, may act to either resist or   drive plate motion (Fig 11.1). An important constraint on the way these tectonic   forces interact is provided by the observation that individual plates are not   accelerating. This requires that a basic force balance or, more strictly, a   torque balance operates on individual plates. In the following discusion we   consider the implications of this reuirement for torque balance for the driving   mechanisms a number of the Earth's plates. <p> <p><a name="tth_fIg11.1"> </a> <a name="stretch"> </a>   <center>    Figure 11.1: <font size="-3">Mantle flow as a driving mechanism.</font>  </center><p> <h2><a name="tth_sEc11.1"> 11.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Torque balance and plate velocity.</h2>A force acting on a lithospheric plate produces a torque, <b>T</b> whose magnitude is given by the cross product of the force <b>F</b> and the radius of the Earth (defined by the radius vector,<b>T</b>) : <center>  <table border=0 align=center>    <tr>      <td>         <table align=left>          <tr>            <td nowrap align=center> <b>T</b> = <b>F</b> &nbsp;<b>x</b> &nbsp;<b>r</b>             </td>        </table>      </td>  </table></center>with a torque pole given by the <em>left-hand rule</em>. <p> <p><a name="tth_fIg11.2"> </a> <a name="stretch"> </a>   <center>    Figure 11.2: <font size="-3">Torque balance.</font>  </center><p> <p> The notion that the plates are not appreciably accelerating implies a torque   balance, which must reflect the interaction between forces which drive plate   motion and those that resist plate motion. It seems reasonable (to me at least)   to assume that the torque pole of the force and/or combintaion of forces driving   plate motion is correlated with the velocity pole, and thus we should be able   to identify the driving forces from the resistive forces, by comparison of torque   poles and velocity poles. <p> There is substantial variation in the absolute velocity of the Earth's major   plates which correlates to some degree with the gravitational torques acting   on the plate ( see reprint Coblentz et al. <em>On the Potential energy of the   Earth's lithosphere</em>) <h2><a name="tth_sEc11.2"> 11.2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;The African plate</h2>The African and Antarctic plates are similar in as much as they are both large, slowly moving plates, incorporating significant continental areas bounded amost entirely by passive margins and oceanic ridge systems with only minor lengths of convergent margin boundaries. Moreover, both are characterised by relative slow absolute velocities and by active continental tectonics dominated by rifting (e.g., the African rift system in Africa and the Ross Sea- Trans-Antarctic Mountain rift system). <p> Traditionally, the rifting that has occurred in the continental regions of   both plates has been seen as the consequence of a process actively involving   the sub-lithospheric mantle, such as the impingement of a plume on the base   of the lithsophere (such as illustrated in Fig. 11.1). It is estimated that   the imingement of a plume at the base of the lithdophere can jack the lithsophere   upo by as much as 1-2 kms, with a corresponding increase in potential energy   of up to 3 x 10<sup>12</sup> N m<sup>-1</sup>. While this is undoubtedly an   important process in generating extensional stress regimes in continents, another   possibility is simply related to the way in which potential energy is distributed   across the plate and how this potential energy distribution evolves in time   as the oceans spread outward around the continent. To understand this it is   useful idealise the African Plate as a completely circular plate which has grown   uniformily with time (Fig.11.3), and imagine how the potential energy of the   plate evolves with time. What is growing with time is largely the old ocean   lithosphere which represents a potential energy low within the plate. Consequently,   the mean plate potential energy must decline with time, and the difference between   the continental potential energy and the mean platte potential energy becomes   progressively greater producing significant tension in the most elevated parts   of the continent. <p> <p><a name="tth_fIg11.3"> </a> <a name="stretch"> </a>   <center>    Figure 11.3: <font size="-3">Circular plate analogy to the African and Antarctic     Plates.</font>  </center><p> <p> For those interested more details can be found in the reprints Sandiford &amp;   Coblentz :<em>Plate scale potential energy differences and the fragmentationof   ageing plates</em>), and Coblentz &amp; Sandiford, <em>Tectonic Stresses in   the African Plate: Constraint on the Ambient Stress State</em>. <p> <h2><a name="tth_sEc11.3"> 11.3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Torque balance in the Indo-Australian   Plate</h2><p> The Indo-Australian (IAP), North American and South American plates form a   group of fast moving "continental" plates (Minister &amp; Jordan, 1978). In   the North American and South American continents the orientation of the maximum   horizontal compression (SH<sub>max</sub>) is well defined and is clearly aligned   with the absolute plate velocity (Richardson, 1992). In contrast, the intraplate   stress field within the Australian continent is complex, and thus cannot easily   be explained by any single tectonic process. Like North America and South American,   but unlike the slower moving plates such as Europe and Africa, the stress field   within the interior of the Australian continent is largely compressional. In   the northern part of the plate SH<sub>max</sub> is aligned N to NNE more or   less orthogonal to the collisional boundary in New Guinea. Elsewhere, the orientation   of SHmax forms a divergent fan resulting in E-W compression in western Australia,   in south-eastern Australia and along the southern margin. While the stress field   in the northern and western part of the continent have been relatively successful   modelled in terms of plate-scale tectonic processes (Cloetingh &amp; Wortel,   1985,1986; Richardson, 1987; Coblentz et al., 1993a), the sources of the E-W   compression in SE Australia remains poorly understood. <p> In the North and South American plates, the uniform intraplate stress field   orientation reflects, in part, the relatively homogeneous boundary configuration   of the plates; both having relatively long mid-ocean ridge segments along their   trailing (eastern) margins and long continental arc-related mountain tracts   along the leading (western) margins. While the IAP is similarly configured with   cooling ocean lithosphere dominating the entire southern boundary, the northern   and eastern convergent boundaries are heterogeneous consisting variously of   continent-continent collisions (Himalaya, New Guinea, New Zealand), continent-arc   collisions (Banda Arc), and oceanic-trench segments (Java Trench, Tonga-Kermadec   trench). Below we show that the compressive stress pattern in the central and   western part of the Australian continent relates to focussing of stresses arising   from the plate-scale distribution of gravitational potential energy along the   Himalayan and New Guinea collision segments. We then show how similar notions   applied to the eastern boundary naturally account for the enigmatic EW compression   observed in SE Australia, and, if correct, considerably down-plays the role   of subduction and basal traction in the IAP intraplate stress field. <p> At the outset it is necessary to emphasize that the main constraint we will   use here to evaluate the origins of the Australian stress field are the orientations   of the in situ stress field. There is now a considerable dataset on stress orientations   for the IAP (Zoback,1992). In contrast, our knowledge of stress magnitudes is   very poor, and remains the subject of some controversy. This is especially the   case for the central Indian Ocean, which is unique in having active deformation   of the oceanic lithosphere in the central Indian Ocean (refernces). <p> The sources of stress that act on plates include: (1) intraplate sources related   to lateral variations in gravitational potential energy of the lithosphere (Coblentz   et al., 1993b), (2) tractions transmitted across convergent plate margins and   (3) tractions at the base of the plate related to its motion over the asthenosphere.   The best understood of these are the intraplate variations in potential energy   in the ocean lithosphere which give rise to "ridge push" of about 2-3 x 10<sup>12</sup>   N m<sup>-1</sup> of young ocean lithosphere on old (&#62; 80 Ma) ocean lithosphere   (note that variations in lithopsheric potential energy can be directly related   to geoid anomalies which for ocean ridges are of the order of 10-15 m, Sandwell   &amp; Schubert, 1980). Other intraplate sources are associated with continental   margins where the difference in potential energy is of the order of 1-2 x 10<sup>12</sup>   N m<sup>-1</sup> (with a corresponding geoid anomaly of about 6 m, Haxby &amp;   Turcotte, 1978; Coblentz &amp; Richardson, 1992; Coblentz et al., 1993b) and   with areas of high topography developed at continental collisional margins (see   discussion below). In comparison with these intraplate stress sources, the magnitudes   of stresses imposed at convergent margins and the tractions at the base of the   plate are poorly constrained, and estimates very by orders of magnitudes (c.f.,   Cloetingh &amp; Wortel, 1985 &amp; 1986; and Richardson, 1987). While the negative   buoyancy of subducting lithosphere is relatively easy to quantify (of the order   of a few times 10<sup>13</sup> N m<sup>-1</sup> for a fully developed slab),   and potentially provides a large "net" tensional force to the trailing plate,   the extent to which the stresses arising from the density defect are dissipated   in the subduction zone is not known. More controversial are the "trench suction"   forces transmitted to the over-riding plate at subduction zones which may apparently   be either compressional or tensional. Continent-continent and continent-arc   collisions are likely to impose considerable resistance to plate motion because   of the buoyancy of continental lithosphere and hence are likely to be a source   of intraplate compression. Some idea of the magnitude of the forces associated   with collisional processes can be determined by the change of the potential   energy associated with the construction of convergent orogens. Precise quantification   of these potential energy changes are difficult to establish because of our   inadequate knowledge of the deep lithospheric density structure, and because   we cannot accurately measure geoid anomalies on the continents. However, the   crustal contribution to the excess potential energy of regions of high elevations   is proportional to the square of the crustal thickening (e.g., England &amp;   McKenzie, 1982), and for the high Himalaya, where crust is approximately double   the normal continental thickness may be as much as 5 - 10 x 10<sup>12</sup>   N m<sup>-1</sup> (Zhou &amp; Sandiford, 1992). <p> Because we have much more confidence in the magnitude of the intraplate sources   of stress, than with forces associated with plate boundaries it is useful to   model the effect of intraplate sources of stress without applying overly stringent   boundary conditions (our modelling strategy is outlined in Appendix 1). We note   that the lateral variations in the lithospheric potential energy provides substantial   torques in a number of plates (e.g. Richardson, 1992, Coblentz et al., 1993).   For plates with the largest gravitational torques (the Pacific, Indo-Australian   and South American), there is good correlation between the gravitational torque   poles and velocity poles (Coblentz et al., 1993), suggesting gravitational torques   may be an important driving mechanism for plate motion. In the IAP the potential   energy distribution produces a torque of 6.43 x 10<sup>25</sup> N m about a   pole at 27<sub>o</sub> N, 62.4<sub>o</sub> E which closely matches the velocity   pole xx<sub>o</sub> N, xx<sub>o</sub> E (the angular misfit is 14<sub>o</sub>).   This torque is mostly reflects potential energy distributions of the ocean ridge   systems along the southern and western margin of the plate (which contribute   8.3 x 10<sup>25</sup> N m-1 about a pole at 40.7<sub>o</sub>N, 31.7<sub>o</sub>E,   but also includes contributions from the continental masses. <p> The assumption that the lithospheric plates are not accelerating (Solomon,   197x; Richardson et al., 1979) and thus are in mechanical equilibrium required   balance of the gravitational potential energy torque by some other forces. The   close correspondence between gravitational potential energy torque poles and   the plate velocity pole requires that the net some of the opposing forces act   against in a sense that is resistive to the current plate motion. Such resistance   may be achieved either by drag at the base of the plate or by resistance along   the convergent margins, and in the following sections we describe the stress   fields for each of these scenarios. Figure 2 shows that the stress field produced   all resistance provided by basal shear bears little resemblance to the observed   stress field. Thus, we consider it is likely that at least some of the torque   balance is achieved by resistance imposed along the northern margin and in Figure   3 we show the the stress fields predicted by applying force balance by fixing   the whole of the northern boundary and by fixing only those segments involving   collision of continental lithosphere of the IAP, that is, Himalaya, New Guinea   and New Zealand <p> The match between the observed and predicted stress fields is far better for   Figure 3b than for Figure 3a, especially for the western Australia, suggesting   that much of the compressional stress within the IAP is the result of focusing   the potential energy torque (mostly arising form ridge push) along collisional   boundary segments. The predicted occurrence of EW compression in SE Australia   in Figure 3b is of particular importance in that it is in accords with the evidence   of a range of in-situ stress indicators (e.g., Zoback, 1992) the origin of which   hitherto has been enigmatic. This predicted compression arises from the collisional   segment of the plate boundary in New Zealand. <p> An important aspect of the results indicated in Figure 3b is that the main   features of the Australian continental stress field can be reproduced by the   interaction of two governing processes, namely gravitational potential energy   torques (mainly due to "ridge push") and collisional resistance. Figure 3b clearly   shows that the main complexity in the stress field reflects the heterogeneous   disposition of the collisional segments along the northern and eastern convergent   boundaries of the IAP. If this interpretation of the intraplate stress field   is correct it raises the important question of the role of subduction at convergent   boundaries in the intraplate stress field, the implication being that subduction   processes provide, at best, a second-order control on the IAP stress field.   We return to this question following a discussion of the predicted stress magnitudes. <p> The main conclusions that stem form the work presented here, which may have   important global implications are: <ul>  <p>   <li> torques arising from plate-scale potential energy distributions, including     ridge push, are significant first-order controls on the in situ stress field     (Richardson, 1992), even in plates with complex stress fields such as the     IAP.     <p>   <li> the orientation and magnitude of the stresses resulting from plate-scale     potential energy distributions may be significantly modified by focussing     effects along heterogeneous convergent boundaries. Indeed, in order to develop     significant compression within continents it may be necessary to have some     focussing.     <p>   <li> the effects of subduction and basal shear are not necessary to explain     the gross features of the Australian stress field, and thus seem to be second-order     features. </ul><p> Finally, the analysis presented here suggests that the complexity in the Australian   stress field, in comparison with other continents such as North America and   South America seems simply to reflect the heterogeneous convergent boundary   conditions operating on the northern and eastern boundary. While the role of   the northern boundary of the IAP has long been suspected, our new interpretation   of the origin of the E-W compression in the SE Australia further emphasizes   the importance of stress focussing at collisional boundaries. <p> Also See preprint Sandiford et al. <em>Focussing ridge torques during continental   collision in the Indo-Australian plate</em> </body></html>
