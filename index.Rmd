<!-- ### Tampa^[written while working in the Pilbara at the time of the Tampa crisis. It was an event that had a profound impact on me - a "geological fault line" of shame on the Australian psyche that demonstrated our diminished humanity. We continue to live in the shadow of this awful event, for which we owe the world an apology.] -->

<!-- Who are we who\ -->
<!-- will not say sorry\ -->
<!-- so afraid for what?  -->


<!-- Of what we have or\ -->
<!-- those that have\ -->
<!-- what we have not? -->


<!-- So should we not\ -->
<!-- say our sorry\ -->
<!-- and be not afraid?  -->

<!-- Of being. -->
