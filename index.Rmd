I am a geologist who works on landscapes, mountains and earth energetics. My research has taken me to many remote parts of the planet including in Antarctica, Australia, Timor, Tibet and Bhutan, where I have been privileged to meet and work with communities that have lived for millennia in some of the most dynamic parts of our planet.  In undertaking basic geological mapping in countries such as Timor I hope to contribute to local agencies making informed decisions about their best use of their  geological endowments and heritage.  My research on the origin and evolution of the continents has been recognised with the award of the Academy of Science's Mawson Medal for 'outstanding contributions to earth science in Australia'. I am a Redmond Barry Distinguished Professor at the University of Melbourne and a Fellow of the Australian Academy of Sciences. I have been a regular contributor to popular press on geological and energy issues.


### The Tampa^[I wrote this while working in the Pilbara at the time of the Tampa crisis. It was an event which profoundly affected me - a "geological fault line" of shame in the Australian psyche that conitnues to play out in our view of the works around us, and our diminished humanity.]

Who are we who\
will not say sorry\
so afraid for what? 


Of what we have or\
those that have\
what we have not?


So should we not\
say our sorry\
and be not afraid? 

of being.
