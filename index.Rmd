I am a geologist who works on landscapes, mountains and earth energetics. My research has taken me to many remote parts of the planet including in Antarctica, Australia, Timor, Tibet and Bhutan, where I have been privileged to meet and work amongst communities that have lived for millennia in some of the most dynamic parts of our planet. I am a Redmond Barry Distinguished Professor at the University of Melbourne and a Fellow of the Australian Academy of Sciences. I have been a regular contributor to popular press on geological and energy issues.


### Tampa^[written while working in the Pilbara at the time of the Tampa crisis. It was an event that had a profound impact on me - a "geological fault line" of shame on the Australian psyche that demonstrated our diminished humanity. We continue to live in the shadow of this awful event, for which we owe the world an apology.]

Who are we who\
will not say sorry\
so afraid for what? 


Of what we have or\
those that have\
what we have not?


So should we not\
say our sorry\
and be not afraid? 

Of being.
